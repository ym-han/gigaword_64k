BEIJING MIGHT USE BALLISTIC MISSILES TO ATTACK TAIWAN: MAGAZINE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China has deployed three or four
ballistic missile brigades in its coastal provinces targeting Taiwan,
according to the latest quarterly on national defense policies issued
by the Taipei-based Society for Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
Among these missiles, modified M11A and M9A missiles have a
range of 600 kilometers and 800 kilometers, respectively and can
strike any area of Taiwan, according to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
The magazine, titled "Review of National Defense Policies, "
quoted a U.S. Defense Department report as saying that in 2002, the
mainland deployed 350 M-series ballistic missiles against the island,
with the annual increase estimated at about 50 units.
</P>
<P>
But the number had reached 450 units by 2003, far higher than the
estimate conducted by the U.S. Defense Department, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that during the 1995-2003 period, the number of mainland
missiles targeting the island increased at least 11-fold, the
magazine indicates that Beijing is expected to have as many as 600
ballistic missiles deployed against Taiwan by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Most of the missiles have been deployed in the Nanjing military
region, encompassing Fujian, Jiangsi, Guangdong and Chejiang
provinces.

GOVERNMENT URGED NOT TO IGNORE MAINLAND CHINA MARKET COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin
Chii-ming said Monday that the government should not play down the
importance of the vast mainland Chinese market while seeking to help
domestic manufacturers globalize their business operations.
</P>
<P>
Yiin, who has been serving in his current post for 10 years, made
the appeal during a press conference to introduce his new book,
titled "The Turning Point of Taiwan's Economy."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the government and domestic entrepreneurs should not
ignore the growing competition from the mainland, Yiin said that this
market must be included in Taiwan's business globalization project.
</P>
<P>
Yiin claimed that Taiwan is currently facing a host of economic
problems, such as a rising unemployment rate, an expanding gap in
incomes between rich and poor people, the lowering of public
investment, and the crisis of being marginalized from regional
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
In the face of so many challenges, the government must seek to
stage another wave of economic reforms in order to create an
environment favorable for domestic business and industrial
development and then forge a "business operation platform for East
Asian enterprises" by accelerating the country's economic
liberalization and globalization, Yiin added.
</P>
<P>
Yiin further said that "improving the economy" has recently
become a slogan in Taiwan, especially in the run-up to the March 20
presidential election, as political considerations have superseded
economic considerations.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that his new book is not aimed at any specific person,
Yiin said he is hopeful that the release of his book will prompt the
government, the industrial sector and the public in general to be
seriously concerned over the development of Taiwan's economy.

FERRY SERVICE BETWEEN KINMEN, MATSU AND MAINLAND CHINA EXPANDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New measures allowing more people to use
the ferry service between the two outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu and the mainland Chinese ports of Xiamen and Mawei in Fujian
Province took effect Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, Taiwanese who work on the mainland will
be allowed to return to Taiwan via Kinmen and Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Previously, this was only allowed for Taiwanese working in
Fujian, as it is an exception to the country's policy of no direct
transportation links with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , which came up with the
measures to meet President Chen Shui-bian's promise Jan. 30 to a
group of Taiwanese businessmen working on the mainland, estimated
Monday that the new measures will increase the number of passengers
to and from the mainland via this route to 2,000 per day,
representing about 20 percent-25 precent of the number of passengers
who fly to and from the mainland through Hong Kong or Macau every
day.
</P>
<P>
MAC officials said the ferry service might be extended to include
Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, both in Fujian Province, as well as Xiamen
and Mawei -- as long as Beijing agrees.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan businessmen who do not work on the mainland can also opt
to go to the mainland through the two outlying islands but only for
business purposes and they must obtain prior approval, according to
the new measures.
</P>
<P>
A local air carrier has already launched a combined air-sea
service on the route with a round trip ticket priced at NT$5,200.
Passengers choosing this route will fly from Taiwan to Kinmen or
Matsu before being ferried to Xiamen or Mawei.

TAIWAN-U.S. TIES WILL NOT CHANGE AFTER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: OFFICIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Relations between Taiwan and the United
States will not change after the March 20 presidential election, a
government official predicted Monday.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions raised by reporters after attending an
international symposium on Taiwan's national defense held in Taipei,
Lee Ming-hsien, Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States,
said that the United States will continue to support Taiwan in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act regardless of who wins the
election.
</P>
<P>
The United States has a neutral position on Taiwan's presidential
race, Lee noted, adding that Washington is more concerned about the
referendum, which it thinks might involve Taiwan's sovereignty and
its independence or unification with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
These concerns have been eased since President Chen Shui-bian
announced Jan. 16 the two questions to be put to the referendum,
which Lee said have nothing to do with a change in the cross-Taiwan
Strait status quo.
</P>
<P>
Washington now neither opposes nor endorses the referendum to be
held alongside the presidential election in which opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan will challenge Chen's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
The two questions placed by Chen before the electorate are:
Should the government buy new anti-missile systems to counter
Beijing's growing missile build-up? And should the government open
talks with Beijing to establish a peace and stability framework for
cross-strait interaction?

<P>
The Republic of China has not received a
request for political asylum from ousted Haitian President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Neither our embassy in Haiti nor our embassy in the Dominican
Republic has received any asylum requests from Aristide, " said MOFA
spokesman Richard Shih. "We don't have any related information."
</P>
<P>
Shih was responding to a foreign wire service report that
Aristide had left Haiti under pressure of a rebellion at home and
that he might come to Taiwan for political asylum. Aristide is
Haiti's first freely elected president in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Shih said the ROC government is pleased to see that the weeks of
tension and unrest in the Caribbean nation has gradually calmed down
with the resignation of Aristide and the inauguration of an interim
president.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that order can be restored in Haiti soon and that
the situation there will move toward stability and harmony, " Shih
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shih said, the ROC government will continue all
bilateral cooperative projects with Haiti once the situation has
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
The ROC has provided agricultural and engineering assistance to
Haiti for many years. Members of the agricultural and engineering
missions in Haiti, who were evacuated to neighboring Dominican
Republic last week amid the upheaval, will return when it is safe to
do so, Shih said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shih said, more than 10 ROC nationals, including five
embassy staff members and a few ordinary citizens, remain in Haiti.
"They are all safe," Shih said, adding that if any expatriates want
to leave Haiti, the ROC embassy will offer them all necessary
assistance.

<P>
A former navy captain who was involved in
the death of the former chief of the navy's arms procurement
department, Captain Yin Ching-feng, appeared at a local court Monday
to give testimony in the trial of a former coworker accused of
stealing public funds while working at Navy General Headquarters in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Kuo Li-heng, who is a suspect in the death of Yin in 1993, is
already serving a life sentence for corruption in another case.
</P>
<P>
He was brought from jail to appear at the Taipei District Court
as a witness in the trial of former Commander Yuan You-fan, who is
accused of siphoning off the interest on funds earmarked for the
country's purchases of four minesweepers from Germany in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Yuan claimed that his confession used by prosecutors as evidence
against him in the case was dictated to him by Kuo during the navy's
own investigation in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Kuo, however rebutted Yuan's claims.
</P>
<P>
The navy commander-in-chief at the time, Adm. Ye
Chang-tong, was also indicted for trying to cover up Yuan's crime.
</P>
<P>
Instead of bringing Yuan to justice, Ye took advise from his
subordinates and forced him to retire in 1992, said the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Ye argued that Yuan's trial would have exposed the country's
secret purchase of the four minesweepers and might have ruined the
deal as two of the four minesweepers were still being built in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ye noted that Iraq invaded Kuwait at that time and that Germany
was criticized by the United States for selling a pesticide plant to
Iraq, which Washington claimed then used the plant to turn out poison
gas. Under international pressure, Germany then tightened the
restrictions on its arms exports in December 1990 and listed Taiwan
as one of the countries to which it would not sell any weapons.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep the deal secret, Ye said he decided to retire
Yuan rather than get him court-martialled.

<P>
Kaohsiung City will kick off a weekly
coordination meeting starting March 8 in an effort to ward off any
outbreak and spread of dengue fever, Kaohsiung Vice Mayor Lin
Yung-chien announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the announcement following a municipal meeting earlier
in the day in which officials from the health, environmental
protection, education and civil affairs took part to study possible
measures to prevent the mosquito-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the city must move swiftly as the annual rainy season is
expected to begin in April and the temperature is gradually rising
every day. The vice mayor said the city has to pay great attention to
this task because of its special position as a busy seaport and
international air gateway.
</P>
<P>
The city decided to implement the mechanisms after the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level Department of Health
informed the municipal authorities of the city's first-ever
foreign-acquired dengue fever case in the middle of last month.
</P>
<P>
According to the CDC, a Kaohsiung resident was confirmed to have
contracted the disease after developing diarrhea, headache and fever
following a trip to Thailand from Jan. 18 to Feb. 8. The patient has
now fully recovered after receiving treatment.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of this year until Feb. 26, more than 14,000
dengue fever cases, including some fatalities, have been reported in
various countries in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia, Singapore,

<P>
Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i said Monday that
the implementation of the labor insurance program has made great
contributions to the maintenance of laborers' livelihoods and to
social stability over the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony to mark the 54th anniversary of the
implementation of the labor insurance program, Lin noted that some
laborers are suffering "labor pains" of unemployment caused by the
quick transformation of Taiwan's industrial structure and have to
rely on labor insurance relief.
</P>
<P>
For example, Lin said, the government paid unemployment subsidies
worth NT$10.2 billion (US$306 million) to local jobless workers in
2002 when the country saw a dramatically rising unemployment rate. He
added that unemployment subsidy payments dropped to NT$5.46 billion
in 2003 due to the improvement of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Lin further said that during the period, the government also
offered soft loans worth NT$21 billion to jobless workers to help
them support their families or create their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, over 8.1 million workers are covered by the
labor insurance program.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 54 years, the insurance regulations have been
revised several times in line with social evolution to satisfy
laborers' demands, Lin added.

Saying that the government will do everything it can to wipe out

such as vote buying, violence and betting on the election outcome,
Chen said all relevant authorities will focus their investigation in
particular on domestic bookmakers teaming up with foreign bookies to
take bets on the election via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
With less than 20 days to go until the election, no hard evidence
has been collected to show attempts by either side to buy votes, the

FORMER DPP CHAIRMAN TO FAST TO PRESS FOR HALVING OF LEGISLATIVE SEATS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lin Yi-hsiung, a former chairman of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and other members of an
anti-nuclear power group started a 10-day fast relay Monday in front
of the Legislative Yuan to press for the halving of the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Following a recent statement on building the nation based on
honesty and credibility, Lin and Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative
Association (Nuke-4 RIA) members, began the 240-hour fasting relay
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Po-wen, executive director of the association, said that the
fast and sit-in will be carried out by each team in 24-hour shifts.
</P>
<P>
The anti-nuclear activists said, "We don't want promises...we
demand action and results."
</P>
<P>
Nuke-4 RIA noted in a statement that all political parties
promised to halve the number of legislative seats three years ago and
to do so, they also agreed to revise the Constitution to achieve that
end.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal, which should not be delayed for another minute,
the association said in a statement, was stalled in the legislature,
leaving no doubt that the foot-dragging legislature is good for
nothing but showboating and verbal sparring.
</P>
<P>
"The association simply cannot ignore the politicians for so
easily backing down from their promises," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The association demanded that all political parties ask all their
affiliated party members to toe the party line and promptly pass a
proposal to revise the Constitution to halve the legislative seats by
the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The public will then see the determination of all parties, the
statement said, adding that the political parties should not use any
procedural method to pass the buck or try other approaches such as
going into recess to stall the matter.
</P>
<P>
Yeh said that Lin and Lee Yuan-tseh, president of Academia Sinica
and a Nobel laureate, will hold a news conference this Saturday to
further elaborate their cause.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Chien Hsi-chieh, a former legislator and now
executive director of Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan, will join the
relay Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling and opposition parties had mixed reactions
to the latest appeal from Lin and his anti-nuclear supporters.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan presented Lin with
flowers, saying that they will give him full support.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-lang, DPP party whip in the legislature, said that
when Lin and Lee Yuan-tseh recently asked all parties to honor their
promises to halve the number of legislative seats, the DPP said that
the party would "support it 100 percent, " and would ask other
political parties to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
But the Kuomintang (KMT) , the largest opposition party in the
legislature, and its ally, the People First Party (PFP), said that
Lin has a political ax to grind and that they "don't want to dance to
Lin's tune."
</P>
<P>
Liao Feng-teh, KMT party whip in the legislature, said that Lin's
move aims actually to campaign for President Chen.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Yen-kuo, PFP party whip in the legislature, said that though
the party has high respect for the high moral standard of Lin, it
believes that Lin "has no need to campaign for himself in this way."

PRESIDENT CHEN OVERTAKES LIEN IN LATEST DPP POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian now leads his sole
challenger, chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Lien Chan, by
three percentage points, or the largest margin since November,
according to the latest survey conducted by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Wu Nai-jen, spokesman for the DPP ticket of President Chen and
Vice President Annette Lu, said that the party was greatly boosted by
the successful mobilization of over one million people to form a
mammoth human chain throughout Taiwan over the weekend to mark the
Feb. 28 Peace Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
The human chain activitity successfully gave momentum to the
Chen-Lu ticket, propelling their support rating to a new high, while
seeing the support rate for the rival team, the "pan-blue alliance"
of Lien and his running mate, James Soong, chairman of the People
First Party, hit a new low, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wu said, DPP support from undecided voters increased
by between 3 percent and 5 percent, while support from those aged
20-29 widened to 8 percent. The DPP ticket also continues to lead in
the 50-59 age group, and only lags the "pan-blue alliance" slightly
in the 30-49 age group, he added.
</P>
<P>
In southern Taiwan, traditionally the bastion of the DPP's core
supporters, the DPP's lead has been more than 15 percent. The DPP has
a modest lead in central Taiwan, while in Taoyuan, Hsinchu and
Miaoli, it has narrowed the gap with the rival camp.
</P>
<P>
There is still no improvement for the DPP in Taipei City or
eastern Taiwan, Wu said, where the DPP ticket is behind by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the DPP has to make extra efforts to whip up the
support rate for Chen-Lu ticket in these areas.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "Overall, the DPP is cautiously optimistic about the
March 20 presidential election."
</P>
<P>
Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the Chen-Lu ticket, also said
that the "hand-in-hand" human chain event helped break the stalled
presidential campaign and give the DPP a clear lead.
</P>
<P>
But with less than three weeks away from the March 20 election,
neither camp can let down their guard, Chiou said.
</P>
<P>
"Although the DPP is getting better day by day, " he said, "the
party will continue doing all it can to keep a solid lead until we
win the election."

Taiwan will join the Advisory Center on WTO
Law (ACWL) under the name of "Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu Seperate
Customs Territories" next month, a well-placed source in Geneva said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The source said that in order to deal with relevant legal affairs
as well as challenges it might face in future trade dispute

Pointing out that the island has completed all the necessary
procedures for joining the ACWL, the source said that Yen
Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent representative to the WTO, is
expected to sign an accession agreement with the center March 8 on
the government's behalf.
</P>
<P>
The ACWL, which is a public international organization
independent of the WTO, was established in 2001 to provide legal
advice on WTO law, support in WTO dispute settlement proceedings, and
training in WTO law to developing countries and customs territories,
countries with economies in transition and least developed countries.
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 1, 2004, the ACWL had 20 developing country members
entitled to the services of the center and nine developed country

TAIWAN NATIONAL IDENTITY GROWING: ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National identity has been growing in
Taiwan, the Asian Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said in a report from Taipei that Taiwan's
presidential race is putting the spotlight on the growth of a unique
Taiwanese national identity - a trend that suggests the island's
accelerating economic integration with mainland China is not
necessarily bringing the two sides closer to Beijing's goal of
political unification.
</P>
<P>
"The burgeoning sense of national identity was on vivid display
Saturday, as more than one million of Taiwan's 23 million people took
part in a human chain stretching nearly 500 kilometers from the
island's northern tip to its southernmost point," the report said.
</P>
<P>
For decades, the Kuomintang had tried to instill in the Taiwan
people the belief that Taiwan is part of China, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"But with the flourishing of the island's democracy since the
early 1990s and the advent of generations of younger people who
generally have no direct, personal connection to mainland China, a
sense of a separate Taiwanese identity has emerged," it said.
</P>
<P>
The unique Taiwan identity, the report said, is evident in the
actions and statements of President Chen Shui-bian, who has stated
repeatedly that Taiwan and mainland China are separate countries.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese identity has gained strength even as trade and
investment across the Taiwan Strait have exploded.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a poll conducted by National Chengchi
University last June showed that 41.5 percent of the respondents
identify themselves as solely Taiwanese, up from 17.3 percent when
the university conducted its first such poll 11 years earlier.

MOE TO REDUCE CLASS SIZES IN FACE OF DWINDLING STUDENT NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Education (MOE) hopes to
make elementary school class sizes smaller in view of the sharply
declining numbers of new students, an education official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vice Education Minister Wu Ming-ching made the remarks while
giving a report at a Legislative Yuan budget committee meeting to
review the implementation of the central government's 2002 budget.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimated last month that the number of Grade 1
students enrolling for the new school year which begins September
will be about 284,000, or the lowest figure in half a century.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tang Chin-chuan from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) noted that the number of children born in Taiwan in 2003
was only about 220,000, down almost 100,000 from the figure for 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said this will surely affect the number of new student
enrollments which in turn will have a serious impact on the future
development of the nation's education system.
</P>
<P>
Wu responded by saying that a seminar was held on the issue last
week, with participants coming to an initial consensus on reducing
class sizes from the current level of about 30 to 40 students per
class.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry will take the opportunity to reduce class sizes,
but it will not move in the direction of cutting the number of
classes or teachers," he said.

<P>
Singapore Airlines (SIA) is confident
that it will meet its S$600 million (US$350 million) profit target
for the year ending March 31, 2004, the SIA head said in a letter to
all staff Monday.
</P>
<P>
CEO Chew Choon Seng also said that all SIA employees will be
receiving a bonus.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chew said the airline will have to continue cutting
costs because it must achieve a net profit of at least S$1.4 billion
to get a satisfactory return on capital.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's national carrier has definitely gone through some
difficult times over the past year, including the impact of SARS and
the acrimonious disputes between the pilots' union and management
over the issue of pay cuts.
</P>
<P>
But conditions have been improving, and after two quarters of
strong earnings, SIA says it has an "excellent chance" of meeting its
full-year profit targets.

Nearly 1,000 foreign dignitaries have
visited the Republic of China so far this year to see for themselves
the run-up to the March 20 presidential election, according to an
official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum will be held alongside
the election, so the event has become a major focus for the
international community, according to the official, who preferred to
remain anonymous.
</P>

By the end of the first quarter of this year, the official said,
186 delegations comprising 1,000 representatives from advanced
countries, international organizations as well as major media
organizations and think-tanks, will have arrived in Taiwan to gain
first-hand information about the island's democratic development.

WATCHDOG PASSES IMPEACHMENT AGAINST FORMER HOPING HOSPITAL STAFF
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  2 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Control Yuan Tuesday adopted an
impeachment resolution against two medical staff of the Taipei
Municipal Hoping Hospital because of their part in a mass
transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the
facility early last year.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment proposal against Hoping Hospital Superintendent
Wu Kang-wen and Infection Division Chief Lin Jung-ti, co-authored by
Control Yuan members Chao Chang-ping, Chang Teh-ming, Lee Shen-yi and
Liao Chien-nan, was approved 8-1 during a session of the screening
committee of the country's supreme watchdog.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, Wu, who was in charge of the
hospital's administrative affairs and served concurrently as convener
of a task force on SARS infection control, failed to conduct tough
supervision, thorough planning and strict enforcement of various SARS
prevention measures inside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Lin, for his part, did not inform his colleagues that patients
suspected of having been infected with the potentially fatal disease
were hospitalized in the municipal medical facility, thus leading to
a mass transmission inside the hospital, the resolution indicates.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of SARS was first reported at the Hoping Hospital in
April 2003, from where the disease spread to other hospitals around
the island, creating a serious impact on the country's economic
development. The disease also claimed 37 lives in Taiwan.

<P>
Prompted by a bullish atmosphere on the
domestic stock market, stock transactions set new highs Tuesday in
both value and number of transactions, according to a spokesman for
the Securities and Futures Commission under the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Commission Vice Chairman Wu Tang-chie said the number of
committed sales, complete deals and per-minute number of transactions
all set new records during the daily trading session, breaking the
most recent new records set just a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the daily number of committed sales hit a new
high of 2.89 million, up from the previous day's 2.66 million. The
number of completed deals stood at a record high of 1.649 million, a
rise from Monday's 1.5 million. The number of transactions conducted
per minute reached 107,666, a rise from the most recent new record of

The weighed index -- the market's key barometer -- rose by 86.83
points to close at 6,975.26, with the daily transaction value
amounting to NT$247.57 billion (US$7.43 billion) , the highest level
since Feb. 20, 1998, when the figure stood at NT$247.7 billion.

Market dealers said the stock market might encounter technical
drops in the short term with the approach of the March 20
presidential election. However, they predicted that the market will
maintain an upward trend as long as the daily trading value averages
more than the level of NT$166 billion experienced in recent months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Air Force General Headquarters (AFGH)
said Tuesday it will conduct an overall review of security measures
at various air bases and make necessary improvements.
</P>
<P>
The AFGH made the remarks after an unidentified person threw two
Molotov cocktails at the entry guardpost at the tightly guarded
Chiashan air base in Hualien County's Hsincheng township, eastern
Taiwan, late Monday.
</P>
<P>
The home-made bombs did not ignite and the assailant escaped, an
AFGH spokesman said, adding that military police in Hualien County
are investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said all air bases around the country have
heightened security alert and that the AFGH has set aside budget for
improving security facilities at various air bases.
</P>
<P>
Chang Shih-chien, director of the department of political warfare
at the Chiashan air base, said earlier in the day that the two petrol
bombs caused no damage or injuries to personnel or facilities at the
base.
</P>
<P>
Quoting soldiers who were on duty at the guardpost, Chang said
that the unidentified individual, wearing a yellow coat and a helmet,
threw the two Molotov cocktails at the booth from a nearby footpath
at around midnight. He added that the person escaped on foot in the
direction of Peipu.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, military police officers from the Hualien
Military Police Command immediately rushed to the base after
receiving a call for help. The remains of the two Molotov cocktails
were taken away by the military police for examination.
</P>
<P>
The possible motivation behind the act is so far unknown, Chang
said. Meanwhile, patrols and surveillance have been heightened to
ensure security at the base.

All poultry farms located inside a radius
of three kilometers surrounding two farms affected by the H5N2 avian
flu virus have successfully passed initial inspections and tests, a
county government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Ling-sung, director of the Chiayi county government's Bureau

<P>
The mother of a U.S. citizen who
went missing in Taiwan last May paid a visit to Taichung Mayor Jason
Hu Tuesday to ask for his assistance in her search for her missing
son.
</P>
<P>
Barbara Klita, who has made several visits to Taiwan to search
for her son, Fryderyk Mieszko Frontier, told Hu that her son was
attracted by Taiwan's beautiful scenery and came to the island to
take up an English teaching job.
</P>
<P>
Hu encouraged Klita not to give up her hope and continue her
search for her son.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who once served as minister of foreign affairs and as
Taiwan's representative to the United States, wrote a letter in
Chinese to help Klita overcome language barriers when she travels to
other parts of the island to seek local police assistance in the
search of her missing son.
</P>
<P>
Hu also telephoned Hualien County Magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan in
eastern Taiwan to ask him whether he can offer more help to Klita.
</P>
<P>
Frontier arrived in Taiwan May 20, 2003 to take up an English
teaching job at a branch of the Hess Educational Organization in
Chungho, Taipei County, but did not show up for a pre-job training
program May 25 as originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
According to a National Police Administration (NPA) probe,
Frontier stayed at Taipei hostel after his arrival in Taiwan. He told
a hostel information desk staffer that he was going to make a trip to
eastern Taiwan before reporting to Hess for work. Frontier left his
luggage at the Hess Chungho branch before departing for the eastern
county of Hualien.
</P>
<P>
NPA officials said Frontier stayed at the Catholic hostel in
Tienhsiang, in Taroko National Park, from May 21 through May 24. He
checked out of the hostel May 25 and has not been heard from since.
</P>
<P>
The NPA has said on many occasions that it has directed the
Hualien County Police Bureau and the Taroko National Park police to
step up the search for Frontier. Moreover, it urged local citizens to
come forward with any information they might have regarding his
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who has information about the whereabouts of Frontier is
welcome to contact the NPA's foreign affairs office at (02) 2393-0989
or (02) 2394-0238, or the Hualien County Police Bureau at (03)
738-2000," an NPA official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Frontier stands 186 cm tall, weighs 96 kilograms and has curly
brown hair, according to NPA data. He was 28 years old when he came
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the American Institute in
Taiwan in mid-July, Frontier called his former roommate in the United
States May 22, saying that he was going to visit a national park and
return to Taipei May 25. He also expressed an interest in going
hiking and visiting the southern city of Kaohsiung.

TAIPEI PORT BECOMES AUXILIARY PORT TO KEELUNG HARBOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Transportation and Communications Vice
Minister Tsai Tui announced Tuesday the formal upgrading of Taipei
Port as an auxiliary port to the international Keelung Harbor in
northern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the announcement at a ceremony to mark the event, in
which Taipei County Vice Magistrate Lin Shi-yao and Pali township
chief Ker Ching-chang also took part.
</P>
<P>
With its existing three wharves, Taipei Port, in Taipei County's
Pali, will be expanded to a compound with 12 wharves by March 2008,
capable of berthing vessels of more than 80,000 tons, Tsai said,
adding that comprehensive port facilities will be available for lease
and private investment.
</P>
<P>
In line with the upgrading of Taipei Port from a gravel port to
an international container port, the Taipei county government has
also kicked off road construction to help better link the port with
nearby transport facilities, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
The expanded port, including a special zone undergoing screening
by the central government, will become even more competitive and
productive if it forms an air-sea joint transportation network with
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport -- Taiwan's leading air travel
gateway in neighboring Taoyuan County.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, the port will see many distribution companies
set up shop in its compound, creating many job opportunities and
boosting Pali's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Ker hailed the port's expansion as a historic chance for Pali's
development.
</P>
<P>
China Motor General Manager Su Ching-yang said he hopes to sell
more than 150,000 sets of car accessories this year through a planned
automobile distribution center in the port, outperforming last year's
120,000 sets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile that day, a distribution company that signed an
agreement with the port authorities to open a hub in July in the
compound has promised to offer 350 job opportunities for Pali
residents in the initial stage, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The company's chairman, Hung Chen-tung, said that Taipei Port
will provide a sound environment for the automobile industry because
of its low rates and distribution capacities, especially after a free
trade zone is approved to be set up in the port.

CABINET TO BEGIN DISTRIBUTION OF REFERENDUM PUBLICITY BROCHURES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet said Tuesday it has completed
printing what it described as a well-designed publicity pamphlet to
help local voters understand the rationale of Taiwan's first-ever
nationwide referendum to be held alongside the March 20 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said grassroots administrative
offices will begin to distribute copies of the new pamphlet to local
households Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"A total of 8 million copies will be printed to guide the
electorate on how to vote in the upcoming referendum," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet's cover features a railway ticket from Yungkang to
Paoan in the southern Taiwan county of Tainan, dated March 20, 2004.
The two townships' Chinese names mean "ensuring peace and prosperity
permanently." The ticket also carries the nation's official title of
the Republic of China and the Chinese characters meaning "valid
forever."
</P>
<P>
"The cover design is aimed at reminding local voters that their
ballots in the referendum will help ensure Taiwan's permanent
well-being and sustainable development," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet covers five chapters, with each chapter expounding
on a single theme. The topics range from the meaning of referendum,
the significance of the March 20 "peace referendum," clarification of
various "misunderstandings" as to the possible impact of the
referendum and how to vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The brochure also explains that each voter will receive a
presidential election gazette and a referendum gazette
simultaneously, as the two events will be held on the same day.
</P>
<P>
It also contains an illustration featuring the reverse U
shape-voting layout at polling stations. According to the pamphlet,
voters will receive white ballots for the presidential election
first. They must mark their choices and cast their ballots into a
white box before they can proceed to the other counter to receive two
referendum ballots -- one in light pink and the other in dark yellow.
After putting stamps on the two ballots, they have to cast their
ballots into two separate boxes of the same colors.
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked whether Taiwan should install more
anti-missile batteries in the face of mainland China's intensified
military threat and whether Taiwan should negotiate a viable
mechanism with Beijing for peaceful interaction. The two questions
will be printed on two separate ballots.
</P>
<P>
Lin said overseas Taiwanese who do not have legal residence in
Taiwan but have registered with the nation's overseas offices to
return for the election do not have the right to cast ballots in the
referendum. "They can only vote in the presidential election, " he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the Government Information Office (GIO) has produced two
TV commercials urging voters to cast their ballots in the historic
referendum to show the world and Beijing's leaders the Taiwan
people's determination to safeguard their homeland through peace.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lin said, the GIO will distribute 400 "beautifully
designed" publicity posters to attract voters' interest in the
referendum.

CREDIT DEPARTMENTS TAKEOVERS SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION: YU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that any
disputes over the takeover of 36 credit departments of local farmers'
and fishermen's associations by domestic commercial banks must be
resolved through a constitutional interpretation by the Council of
Grand Justices.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks while fielding questions at a general
interpellation session of the Legislative Yuan, during which
Legislator Liu Cheng-hung, of the opposition Kuomintang, and
Legislator Cheng Mei-lan, of the People First Party, lashed out at
the Ministry of Finance for its policy of allowing commercial banks
to take over the 36 credit departments.
</P>
<P>
During their joint interpellation, the two lawmakers pointed out
that some of the credit departments' assets were under-appraised when
taken over by the government-designated banks, thus violating
people's property rights as set forth by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In response, Yu said that the takeover of credit departments is
not tantamount to the takeover of farmers' and fishermen's property.
If there are any different views on relevant laws and regulations,
such disputes should be settled through a constitutional
interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices.
</P>
<P>
The reason why the 36 credit departments were taken over was
because such institutions were poorly-managed and the net value of
their assets was negative, the premier claimed, adding that rights
and interests of local farmers and fishermen would have been
seriously affected if the government had not implemented the
management system.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance issued a position paper,
clarifying that the takeover of the 36 poorly-managed credit
departments was conducted in conformity with the regulations
governing merging of financial institutions as well as the Statutes
for the Establishment and Management of Financial Restructuring Fund.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Progressive Party-led government launched a
financial reform program for local-level credit cooperatives in
August 2001, and it has so far taken over 36 debt-ridden credit
departments of farmers and fishermen's associations while planning to
liquidate those with serious overdue loan problems.
</P>
<P>
According to the program announced by the Ministry of Finance,
local-level credit cooperatives whose overdue loan ratios exceed 25
percent should stop offering new loans, should not raise capital from
their respective members, and must accept government assistance in
management.
</P>
<P>
In the same announcement, the ministry said those local-level
credit cooperatives whose overdue loan ratios stand at between 15
percent and 25 percent should not take any new deposits from
non-members.

<P>
An unidentified individual threw two
Molotov cocktails at the entry guard house at the Chiashan Air Force
Base in Hsincheng township, eastern Hualien County late Monday. The
bombs did not ignite and the assailant was not apprehended, a
spokesman for base authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang Shih-chien, director of the department of political warfare
at the base, said that the two devises, made with wine glass
bottles, caused no damage or injuries to personnel or facilities at
the base.
</P>
<P>
Citing soldiers who were on duty at the guard booth, Chang said
that the unidentified individual, wearing a yellow coat and a helmet,
threw the two Molotov cocktails at the booth from a nearby walking
path around midnight. He added that the person escaped on foot toward
the direction of Peipu.
</P>
<P>
According to Chang, military police officers from the Hualien
Military Police Command immediately rushed to the base after
receiving calls for help. The remains of the two Molotov cocktails
were taken by the military police for examination.
</P>
<P>
The possible motivation behind the act is so far unknown, Chang
said. Meanwhile, patrols and surveillance has been heightened to
ensure security at the base.

INTERNATIONAL LIAISON POLICE COULD HELP TAIWAN INVESTIGATIONS: CIB
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police in Taiwan are considering sending
liaison officers overseas to deal with the growing trend of
international criminal activities, the Criminal Investigation Bureau
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made following recent cooperation among
Taiwan, the United States and Philippine police forces which led to
the discovery and seizure of an illegal drug production factory
operated by Taiwanese in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Criminal Investigation Bureau officers said they have established
closer ties with the international police organization Interpol, and
the next step is to post officers overseas to help with cross-border
investigations.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that in Europe, the United States and Japan, law
enforcement liaison officers are stationed in foreign embassies to
foster closer contact with the local police.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a liaison officer will enhance exchanges of
information, broaden investigations into multi-national crimes and
help in tracking down fugitives," they added.
</P>
<P>
Given Taiwan's relative political isolation, its inability to
sign binding extradition treaties or obtain judicial assistance from
foreign countries, law enforcers in Taiwan are often left with few
resources to pursue criminals who have fled the country.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a liaison officer system would address this
issue, they said.

PRESIDENT CHEN VISITS LEGISLATIVE REFORM HUNGER STRIKERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian threw his support
behind the proposal to halve the number of legislative seats when he
paid a visit to a group of demonstrators in front of the Legislative
Yuan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, lead by Lin Yi-hsiung, a former chairman of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, launched a 240-hour relay
hunger strike at the legislature courtyard Monday to push for the
passage of a constitutional amendment bill before the March 20
presidential election to pave the way for the much-anticipated
reduction of legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day demonstration, organized by the Nuke-4 Referendum
Initiative Association (Nuke-4 RIA) , is being conducted in 24-hour
shifts. President Chen arrived at the demonstration site early in
the morning as the first 24-hour sit-in ended at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to signing his name on a petition asking to halve the
225-seat legislature jointly initiated by Lin and Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh, Chen shook hands with Lin and other
demonstrators to show his regard and support for them.
</P>
<P>
Chen said although the opposition-controlled legislature has
formed a special committee in charge of Constitution-amending
affairs, the committee has yet to call its first meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the 2001 legislative election campaign, Chen recalled that
candidates from across the political spectrum backed the legislative
downsizing proposal.
</P>
<P>
"More than two years have passed; the proposal remains on the
drawing board, " Chen said, adding that the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) ,
which controls a majority in the legislature, is responsible for the
delay of this important legislative reform program.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that both the DPP and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity
Union -- fully support the halving of legislative seats, Chen said
the "pan-blue alliance's" reluctance to cooperate has hindered
legislative reform.
</P>
<P>
As long as KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong
give the green light, Chen said he is convinced that the legislature
can easily pass a constitutional amendment bill to pave the way for
halving the number of legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
"I earnestly hope that lawmakers of different political stripes
can deliver on their campaign promise and pass a seat-reduction bill
before March 20 in response to Lin's appeal," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Braving cold wind and rain, Lin and other demonstrators, most of
whom are opponents of the nation's controversial Fourth Nuclear Power
Plant now under construction in Taipei County, staged the peaceful
hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he would continue the sit-in fast after the first
24-hour session ended. He expressed gratitude for President Chen's
concern about his group's cause.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Nuke-4 RIA's current campaign is aimed at
promoting the establishment of a refined political culture
characterized by honesty and credibility, Lin said he hopes all
domestic political figures can faithfully honor their campaign
promises.
</P>
<P>
"We are fed up with politicians making promises and breaking them
so easily. As legislative reforms and reduction of legislative seats
have become mainstream public opinions, top leaders of various
political parties should direct their lawmakers to take action to
realize the goal of halving the legislative seats as the first step
of legislative reforms," Lin urged.
</P>
<P>
Lin said he and Academia Sinica President Lee will unveil the
results of their signature campaign for the legislative reform
initiative at a joint news conference this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers' claim that the DPP
administration should call a referendum on the fate of the half-built
Fourth Nuclear Power Plant instead of the so-called "peace
referendum" against mainland China's missile threat, Lin said the
Referendum Act passed last November doesn't authorize the Cabinet to
hold a referendum on the nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Referendum Act, Lin said, only civic groups can
initiate a nuclear power plant referendum with the endorsement of
700,000 individual citizens.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tall order for any civic group to secure such a large
number of endorsements," Lin said, adding that this seriously flawed
Referendum Act should be revised and improved in the future.

PASSENGER, CARGO TRAVEL GROWS RAPIDLY AT CKS TERMINAL

Taipei, March 26 (CNA)

<P>
The number of passengers and the volume of
cargo handled at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in
northern Taiwan has been growing every year since its operations
began 25 years ago, except for last year which saw outbreaks of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) , according to airport
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The tallies compiled by airport authorities show that a total of
a little more than four million passengers entered, left and
transferred in Taiwan via the airport in 1979 after it began
operations on Feb. 26 of that year.
</P>
<P>
The figure rose to top 10 million in 1990 and peaked at 19.22
million in 2002 -- the largest number of passengers ever seen by the
Taiwan's largest air travel gateway, which is located in Taoyuan
County.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, the number of passengers using the airport dropped to
15.51 million as a result of the outbreaks of the potentially deadly
SARS, a level similar to that recorded in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the volume of cargo dealt with by the airport
registered an all-time high of over 1.5 billion kilograms last year
-- 829 million kilograms of imports and 671 million kilograms of
exports, an astounding jump from its first-year level of 117 million
kilograms, the same statistic show.

RIOTING HIGHLY UNLIKELY AFTER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: DEFENSE MINISTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rioting after the March 20 presidential
election and referendum vote is highly unlikely given that the people
of Taiwan have become very familiar with democratic elections over
the years, a Ministry of National Defense spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng made the remarks at a regular news
conference when he was asked about the possibility of unrest after
the election.
</P>
<P>
Pollsters say the race is currently too close to call. Incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu are facing off
against opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his running
mate, James Soong, chairman of the People First Party. Taiwan will
also be holding its first nationwide referendum on election day.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that the defense ministry has received no instructions
indicating that there could be trouble to the extent that a state of
emergency could be declared after the election.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the nation's armed forces are, as usual, always
refining their combat preparedness to ensure national security. The
defense ministry is also well aware of any military movements of the
mainland Chinese military, especially regarding those of its missiles
and submarine forces.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that mainland China's military is not doing anything
out of the ordinary currently. "If there are any unusual activities,
the ROC Army will act accordingly."
</P>
<P>
In addition, a 39-hour heightened alert will be in effect before,
during and after the March 20 election, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that from 5 p.m. March 19 to 8 a.m. March 21, the armed
forces on duty in Taiwan proper or on the outlying islands will be on
round-the-clock heightened alert so that "the public will cast their
ballots in a safe and secure environment."
</P>
<P>
On possible rioting by supporters of different camps, Huang said,
"I believe this will not happen, judging from the experience the
people of Taiwan have had in numerous elections over the years."
</P>
<P>
The army is mainly concerned with foreign threats, Huang said,
and will leave possible rioting to the National Police
Administration.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS MULLING ESTABLISHING RFID R&amp;D HUB IN TAIWAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Sun Microsystems is considering
establishing another radio frequency identification (RFID) technology
research and development center in the Asia-Pacific region and Taiwan
is on the list of possible sites.
</P>
<P>
Believing that applications of RFID technology will definitely
generate a vast market and profits worldwide, Sun Microsystems has
already established RFID testing centers in the United States and
Scotland, in addition to the one planned for Australia, said Kevin
Mayo, chief architect of the Sun Microsystems Asia Pacific
Infrastructure Solution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Taipei to solicit support from
Taiwan manufacturers, Mayo said RFID technology is more sophisticated
than conventional bar code application technology, which can only
enable the storage and reading of commercial products' names, prices
and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The Sun Microsystems-developed RFID technology, however, provides
scanning systems which enable high-performance reading capability,
allowing more information about the products, including place of
origin, manufacturing date and shipment lot sequence, be carried in
bar codes, and be read as well, Mayo noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayo, Taiwan is one of the three places that Sun
Microsystems is targeting for the building of its second R&amp;D and
testing center in the Asia-Pacific region following the one already
planned in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Mayo disclosed that Sun Microsystems authorities are expected to
announce their decision on this in April or May.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chairman Lin Yi-hsiung on Tuesday urged all political parties and
their lawmakers to deliver on the promises they made more than three
years ago to push for a downsized legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lin and members of the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association
(Nuke-4 RIA) began a 10-day fasting relay campaign Monday in front of
the Legislative Yuan building to press for the halving of the
225-seat Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that all political parties promised to halve the number
of legislative seats three years ago but that up to now nothing has
been done.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all political parties to ask their party members
to toe the party line and promptly pass a proposal to revise the
Constitution to halve the number of legislative seats before the
March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian visited Lin during the sit-in fast as a
gesture of support. Chen called for cooperation by legislators from
the opposition parties to help honor their promises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lin criticized the recently passed Referendum Law as
"absurd" because it prevents the Executive Yuan from initiating a
nationwide referendum on whether or not to halt construction of the
Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, and stipulates a high threshold for
private organizations to initiate a referendum on the same issue.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Referendum Law demands that 700,000 people
endorse a referendum initiative by a private organization, Lin said
that there is currently no private organization in Taiwan that is
capable of achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
Lin asked lawmakers from across the political spectrum to amend
the "senseless" Referendum Law.

MAN SAYS SMUGGLED HEROIN ONLY TO RELIEVE HIS SUFFERING

<TEXT>
<P>
A man who was arrested Monday night for
smuggling heroin into Taiwan said that he was bringing in the drug to
ease his pain caused by cancer.
</P>
<P>
The cancer patient, who also admitted that he had become a drug
addict since being diagnosed with oral cancer, lympocancer, and
tuberculosis in 2002, was arrested at Kaohsiung International Airport
with heroin hidden in his shoes. He was returning from a trip to
mainland China, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said Yen Kuo-hsien, 57, was stopped at the airport Monday
night because his shoes looked too big for his build and he was
acting suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
After a thorough check, they found heroin hidden in secret
compartments in his shoes, with 370.1 grams in his left shoe and
297.9 grams in the right one. The 668 grams of heroin has an
estimated street value of NT$10 million (US$301,200).
</P>
<P>
Yen told police that after being diagnosed with cancer he began
smoking more than 10 heroin-laced cigarettes a day to relieve his
suffering.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Yen went to Zhuhai for sightseeing, where he met a
woman in a park who was doing drugs. Yen asked her how he could get
heroin and how much it would cost.
</P>
<P>
He went to Zhuhai again Feb. 26 this year and through the woman
bought NT$650,000-worth of heroin from a man.
</P>
<P>
Yen was turned over to the Kaohsiung Prosecutors' Office for
violating the drug prevention law.
</P>
<P>
Police are now investigating whether Yen was part of a smuggling
ring that uses people with cancer or who are terminally ill as
couriers to bring in illegal substances.

BEIJING ASKED NOT TO REACT WITH BLUSTER TO DEMONSTRATION IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland China has been asked not to
choose bluster in response to the huge demonstration against Beijing
in Taiwan this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Wall Street Journal said in its editorial xxxday that
mainland China has a choice in how to react to the demonstration. It
can see it as another provocation by Taiwan's president, Chen
Shui-bian, or it can see the rally as yet another sign that their own
intransigence wins few hearts and minds among Chinese on the mainland
and off. "This was the most important message the Taiwanese were
sending," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to Beijing, but if it chooses bluster in response to the
first reality, it will only exacerbate the second, " the editorial
added.
</P>
<P>
The editorial also said that the inspiration for the event -- a
human chain linking Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1989 as the
three Baltic states were defying the Soviet Union prior to their
independence -- carried an unmistakable message.
</P>

TAIWAN TO JOIN WTO LEGAL ADVISORY CENTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
Tuesday that Taiwan will join the Advisory Center on WTO Law (ACWL)
soon to obtain a full understanding of the rights and obligations
under the World Trade Organization (WTO) system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference, Pu Kuo-ching, a section
chief with the foreign ministry's treaty and legal affairs division,
said the Republic of China will become a formal ACWL member next
month under the designation of the "Separate Customs Territory of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."
</P>
<P>
According to ACWL rules, Taiwan has to pay an admission fee of
US$300,000. Pu said Taiwan has completed all membership application
procedures and that the ROC's representative to the WTO will sign an
entry protocol in Geneva March 8 on behalf of the government.
</P>
<P>
Besides Taiwan, Pu said, several other countries, including
Switzerland and El Salvador, are also seeking to join the ACWL to
acquire legal counseling about the WTO agreements, particularly its
disputes settlement mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Pu said the ACWL was established in July 2001 as a unique
inter-governmental organization, independent of the WTO, to provide
legal advice to developing and least-developed countries, customs
territories and economies. Its nine founding members -- Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Holland, Norway, Sweden and Britain
-- have each donated US$1 million to help finance ACWL operations. So
far 23 developing countries have joined the organization.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the WTO has created a complex legal system with
elaborate procedures for the settlement of disputes, Pu said
effective access to those procedures is essential to ensure the
enforcement and maintenance of each WTO member's rights.
</P>
<P>
"After joining the ACWL, we'll obtain legal advice on WTO laws,
acquire support in WTO dispute settlement proceedings and receive
assistance in training of government officials in WTO laws through
seminars and other applicable means," Pu added.

ROC DOING UTMOST TO MAINTAIN TIES WITH HAITI

<TEXT>
<P>
Republic of China officials in Haiti are
doing their utmost to build communication channels with the new
Haitian government and keep bilateral diplomatic relations intact,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Richard Shih said that MOFA officials are
sparing no efforts in seeking close contact with the new Haitian
government after Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide resigned
and left the country as a result of nationwide unrest. Boniface
Alexandre, Aristide's constitutional successor, was sworn in as an
interim president Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shih made the remarks after reporters asked him whether the entry
of U.N. peacekeeping forces into Haiti would have the same adverse
impact on Taiwan's diplomatic front as the entry of U.N. peacekeeping
troops into Liberia in October 2003. The ROC and Liberia severed
formal diplomatic ties shortly after U.N. troops were deployed to the
west African nation following disorder caused by rebel advancements.
Mainland China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Shih stressed that the ROC will continue to bolster bilateral
ties with the new Haitian government after the situation in the
Caribbean island nation stabilizes. The ROC has maintained formal
diplomatic relations with Haiti for 47 years.
</P>
<P>
He added that members of the ROC agricultural and engineering
missions in Haiti, who were evacuated to the neighboring Dominican
Republic last week amid the upheaval, will return when it is safe to
do so.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shih said, more than 10 ROC nationals, including five
embassy staff members and a few ordinary citizens, remain in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shih said, the ROC government will continue all
bilateral cooperative projects with Haiti once the situation there
has stabilized.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of rice, which have been promised by the ROC
government, will be made to Haiti as long as order is restored, Shih
added.

MOFA TO INVITE FOREIGN PUNDITS TO OBSERVE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Tuesday it is inviting foreign pundits and journalists to come to
Taiwan to see for themselves the Republic of China's March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference, Chieh Wen-chi, deputy
director of the MOFA's International Organizations Department, said
the MOFA has invited the Association of Asian Election Authorities
(AAEA) to organize a delegation to Taiwan to witness the ROC's
progress in political democratization and electoral system
advancement.
</P>
<P>
According to Chieh, the AAEA was formed in 1997 to promote and
institutionalize open and transparent elections, independent and
impartial election authorities, the professionalization of Asian
election authorities, citizen participation in the electoral and
civic process, information sharing, and the development of resources
for election-related information and research.
</P>
<P>
Chieh said the MOFA is also organizing a delegation of foreign
press groups stationed at the U.N. headquarters in New York to come
to Taiwan to observe the upcoming presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
It will be Taiwan's third direct presidential election. On the
day of the election, the nation's first-ever referendum will also be
held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Various public opinion polls have shown that the two-way
presidential race between the Democratic Progressive Party ticket of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu and the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong is running in a dead
heat.

DILUTED SMALLPOX VACCINE DOSE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE: NTU RESEARCHERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diluted smallpox vaccine doses are equally
effective in producing antibodies in humans as doses that have not
been diluted, researchers at National Taiwan University (NTU)
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chang Shang-chun, director of NTU Hospital's Department of
Infectious Disease, said diluted doses are as effective in allowing
people to ward off smallpox in the event of a bioterrorism attack.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan currently has roughly 2 million undiluted doses of
smallpox vaccine, the island has enough vaccine for the entire
population if the doses are diluted, Chang noted.
</P>
<P>
Clinical tests on more than 200 volunteers conducted at the NTU
Hospital over the past several months found that all three groups of
volunteers -- vaccinated with five-fold diluted, 10-fold diluted and
30-fold diluted smallpox vaccine doses, respectively -- showed
satisfactory results in terms of immunity to smallpox, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory analysis found that 100 percent of the volunteers who
had previously received smallpox vaccination showed immune response
when administered with a 30-fold diluted dose of smallpox vaccine,
while 100 percent of those who had not previously received a smallpox
vaccination showed an immune response when given a 10-fold diluted
dose, Chang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that side effects of smallpox vaccination include fever,
headache, muscle aches, lymphatic swelling and skin rashes, adding
that one out of every 1 million people may develop encephalitis and
die.
</P>
<P>
He noted that children under the age of one and seniors aged over
65 are discouraged to receive any kind of smallpox vaccine as they
have weaker immune systems.

TWO DEBATERS  CALL FOR BOYCOTT OF REFERENDUM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two privates citizens, including former
Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang, called for the
public to boycott the March 20 referendum in the second round of
televised debate on the two questions in the referendum Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's first debate of the first question in the
referendum -- whether the country should strengthen its anti-missile
defense system -- Chan Chao-li, a poet and activist for the right of
farmers and fishermen, questioned the government's wisdom in setting
aside NT$700 billion (US$)(US$21.02 billion) to buy anti-missile
defense systems from the United State when the country is trying to
borrow money to finance its 10 major construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the country has already run into debt of NT$9.3
trillion (US$279.27 billion), or NT$400,000 (US$12,012) per capita,
the poet said that the government is not in its right mind if it
wants to buy more weapons to fill its arsenal against this
background.
</P>
<P>
Instead of guaranteeing the country's safety, Chang warned that
the anti-missile defense system will only trigger a arms race between
Taiwan and the mainland and sink the country deeper into debt.
</P>
<P>
He urged his countrymen to steer clear of the referendum,
claiming that they can highlight their wisdom and the country's
democracy by refraining from voting in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The speaker for the affirmative side in the debate, Deputy
Secretary-General to the President Joseph Wu overlooked his opponent
by making a strong appeal to his audience, saying moves toward
democracy always have had detractors, just as is the case regarding
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of national defense and the
government's attention to the well-being of farmers and fishermen,
citing the country's ever-increasing social welfare expenditure as
evidence.
</P>
<P>
In the second debate, Hsu Hsin-liang argued against Minister
without Portfolio Yeh Chun-jung over whether the government should
negotiate with Beijing for the establishment of a peace and stability
interaction framework.
</P>
<P>
Hsu claimed a yes vote on the question will be tantamount to
forcing the government to accept Beijing's "one-China" policy because
the referendum question doesn't ask the country's negotiator to
defend Taiwan's sovereignty while Beijing's precondition for any
political talks with Taiwan is its "one-China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The government which is obliged to follow the result of the
referendum can't help but accept Beijing's prerequisite to open
negotiation with mainland China, Hsu claimed.
</P>
<P>
Yeh dismissed Hsu's worries, claiming it is out of the question
that the Democratic Progressive Party's administration would accept
the "one-China" policy simply for talks with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Accept the 'one-China' policy would be a change of the country's
status quo which needs the consent of the people as the DPP has
always said," Ye argued.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's debate is the second of five rounds before March 14.
The Central Election Commission which organizes the debates hopes to
deepen the public's understanding of the referendum through these
debates.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i laid emphasis on
the importance of innovation as well as research and development
Wednesday while delivering a speech to a group of business leaders in
central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"While increasing industrial upgrading, we must also boost
various research and development projects so that we can have a
brighter future, " Lin said in his speech about the current situation
and outlook for Taiwan's economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Originally, Taiwan relied on the manufacturing sector as a
locomotive for its economic development, but the country has been
experiencing a transformation in the industrial structure over the
past years, " Lin said. "If we want to make great strides, it is
imperative for us to accelerate industrial upgrading and enhance
innovations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that research and development are of great importance for
increasing the added-value of domestic industries, Lin said that the
government will continue to provide funds to help local manufacturers
carry out various research and development projects.
</P>
<P>
As for many manufacturers' relocating their production lines to
mainland China to lower production costs, Lin said that he hopes that
the manufacturing sector will think twice before doing so. "It is
nothing but shifting to a new arena of competition, " Lin explained,
adding that he is sure local manufacturers will not profit from their
business operations on the mainland.

During his speech, Lin cited official figures concerning the

PLAN TO DEMAND FINANCIAL GUARANTEE FOR MAINLAND SPOUSES DELAYED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 3 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's new measure requiring local
residents to produce NT$5 million (US$151,050) as a financial
guarantee if they have mainland Chinese spouses who want to settle in
Taiwan will not come into force until June 1 this year, an official
with the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly revised regulations concerning the
settlement or residency of mainland Chinese people in Taiwan, the new
measure took effect March 1, but the MOI decided to extend a
three-month grace period after receiving strong complaints from local
residents and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of the Interior Chien Tai-lang said that starting
from June 1, all Taiwanese residents that apply for permanent
settlement on behalf of their spouses from mainland China will have
to abide by the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
The revised regulations, in line with the Nationality Law,
stipulate that mainland people wanting to settle or reside in Taiwan
must meet certain financial conditions, such as an average monthly
income over the past year of at least twice Taiwan's basic salary of
NT$15,840 (US$477).
</P>
<P>
Failing that, their Taiwanese spouses must present evidence that
they have assets worth over NT$5 million so that they can provide for
their mainland spouses in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
If put into force, the new measure is expected to affect many
less wealthy Taiwanese residents who are considering marrying
mainland brides.
</P>
<P>
Chien also explained that only those who apply to come to Taiwan for
settlement will be required to provide the NT$5 million financial
guarantee, while those who only come to Taiwan to be reunited with
their families will not be required to post such a guarantee.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two prominent businessmen were lauded by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Wednesday because of their
outstanding performance in expanding Taiwan's trade and business with
India and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Namchow Chemical Chairman Chen Fei-lung and Nantai Group Chairman
Yang Ching-shuan received citations from Minister Lin Yi-fu at the
MOEA headquarters in Taipei, with scores of business community
representatives and government officials witnessing the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who once served as secretary-general of the India Committee
under the Chinese International Economic Cooperation Association
(CIECA) from 1994 to 2003, was an outstanding figure in helping
Taiwan companies break into the vast but unfamiliar Indian market.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Chen's efforts, two-way Taiwan-India trade swelled to
an all-time high of US$1.4 billion in 2003, 100 percent up from the
1994 level of US$700 million.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who was leader of the Republic of China- Republic of South
Africa Committee under the CIECA during the 1995-2003 period, has
been a long-time promoter in boosting bilateral trade and economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is also an honorary consul of the Kingdom of Swaziland,
has many times helped Taiwan trade-promotion delegations meet ranking
government officials in South Africa and Swaziland to forge
cooperative ventures.

JAPAN IN DANGER IF TAIWAN IS UNIFIED WITH  MAINLAND CHINA: OBSERVER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo, March 3 (CNA)
(By Perry Hsieh and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan has a relatively mature democracy and
a free society, and no matter who wins the March 20 presidential
election, its democratic system will not experience drastic changes,
a senior editorial writer of a Japanese nationwide daily said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But Seiji Yajima of Sankei Shimbun also said that if Taiwan is
united with mainland China, the interests and security of Japan will
be seriously compromised.
</P>
<P>
The former chief of the daily's Taipei bureau made the remarks
while he delivered a speech at a meeting in Tokyo on Taiwan's
presidential election and its prospects.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both the United States and Japan have expressed
serious concerns about Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum alongside
the presidential election and asked for discretion, saying that both
have their own reasons and considerations when making the unexpected
diplomatic move.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States has basically maintained its
longstanding stance on its strategy and foreign policy toward Taiwan,
as well as friendly attitude, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Yajima said that the "hand-in-hand" human
chain rally held in Taiwan over the weekend by supporters of
President Chen Shui-bian was very successful, although it will be
hard to say whether the rally has successfully inspired voters or
made an effect on the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
He observed that President Chen and his sole rival, Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan, are still running neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that because of the undecided voters and close
surveys, the situation may only become more clear in the last two
weeks to the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yajima, who was in Kaohsiung when more than one million people
stretched along 500 kilometers of the island and joined hands to
shout "yes to Taiwan" and "no to China" Saturday afternoon, also said
that he was impressed by the event.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of the passion of the people, the number of
participants at the event had been bigger than expected. The rally
was conducted in a rational and peaceful fashion without chaos or any
unfavorable incidents.
</P>
<P>
He especially lauded the manners of the Taiwan people, saying
that immediately after the end of the activity, people began picking
up litter along the path of the human chain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Japanese lawmaker spoke about his recently concluded
visit to Taiwan on the same occasion.
</P>
<P>
Hirostao Nakatsugawa of the Democratic Party said that he was
positive of and impressed by Taiwan's democratization and
internalization.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed support for Taiwan's referendum to be held in
tandem with the presidential election and lashed out again at the
Japanese Foreign ministry for interfering Taiwan's internal affairs.

CHUNGHWA TELECOM LAUNCHES VIDEO-ON-DEMAND SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State-run Chunghwa Telecom officially
launched its video-on-demand service Wednesday after months of
trials.
</P>
<P>
The service, known as MOD or multimedia-on-demand, is similar to
a neighborhood video rental store, but is provided on the Chunghwa
Telecom's metropolitan network.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony marking the inauguration of the service, Ho
Chen-tan, chairman of Chunghwa Telecom said subscribers can choose
video from 13 channels offered by the company through an additional
set-top box for a fee no greater than the current charge of NT$600
(US$18) for most cable television services. Chunghwa currently has
20,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
The 13 new channels will run content on entertainment, public
interest, education, news and movies.
</P>
<P>
The company is first offering the service in Taipei County and
will expand to Taipei City and other parts of the island, said Ho.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, President Chen Shui-bian said the
company's MOD service has partially realized his administration's
dream of using the newest technology to improve people's daily life.
</P>
<P>
Hung Chong-juan, deputy director-general of the Government
Information Office lauded this as a milestone in the country's
television broadcast industry, because "people now can choose not
only the president but TV programs."
</P>
<P>
Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang said Chen's "new"
administration is devoted to the development of new technology and
thereby deserves part of the credit in bringing about the MOD
service.

COA TO INVEST NT$600 MILLION TO PROMOTE TAIWAN-GROWN FARM PRODUCE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) under the
Executive Yuan will invest NT$600 million in the coming three years
to help promote Taiwan-made farm products in the international
market, according to a COA official.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ming-lai, director-general of the COA's International
Cooperation Department, made the remarks during a roundtable forum
held at the Central News Agency on how to effectively promote
Taiwan-made agricultural products in the international market.
</P>
<P>
In line with a global promotion package aimed at stepping up
Taiwan's exports of agricultural products, a budget of NT$300 million
will be earmarked to set up special export zones for locally grown
products, such as bananas, soybeans and papayas, while the other
NT$300 million will be invested to boost exports of Taiwan's flagship
agricultural products, such as orchids and oolong tea, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The first special zone for soybeans is scheduled to be
inaugurated on a 1,500 hectare plot of land in the southern county of
Pingtung, Wang noted, adding that the COA is also planning to
establish a banana export zone on land belonging to the state-run
Taiwan Sugar Corp. in Pingtung County.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the COA will enhance quarantine measures in
the planned export zones to facilitate exports of Taiwan-grown
produce to foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
All lawmakers, government officials and representatives from the
domestic business community who attended the symposium threw their
support behind the COA project to upgrade the competitiveness of
local farm produce in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lin Kuo-hua of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
said that Taiwan opened its market to foreign farm products following
its entry into the World Trade Organization, so the government should
help local farmers seek new outlets for their quality farm products.
</P>
<P>
Citing lettuce produced in his constituency of Yunlin County as
an example, Lin said that it is of excellent quality and is usually
used by foreign restaurants to make salads, so it is a sufficiently
high standard for export to overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Lin also proposed that the government procure streamlined
quarantine and inspection equipment for the planned special marketing
zone for local farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, Yeh Ming-shui, marketing director
of the quasi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TETRA) , claimed that agricultural production costs in Taiwan are
very high because of a micro-agricultural system.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, it is imperative for domestic farmers to create an
excellent image to facilitate the promotion of their products in the
international market, Yeh said.

TAIWAN PROMOTES CHICKEN EXPORTS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is promoting chicken exports,
targeting 18 regions and countries, including Japan, Hong Kong, Saudi
Arabia and Indonesia, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
COA Vice Chairman Hu Fu-hsiung made the remarks in a meeting to
discuss infectious diseases among animals, which was presided over by
COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung and Hu Sheng-cheng, a minister without
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The COA vice chairman noted that Taiwan is not an affected area
with regard to the virulent H5N1 avian flu virus, although local fowl
have been found to have been infected with H5N2, a less virulent
strain of the disease that nevertheless prompted the culling of tens
of thousands of chickens in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The COA will try to persuade countries such as Japan and Hong
Kong, which have reported bird flu cases in their countries, to
resume importing chicken from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hu reported that it is known that the Czech Republic has agreed
to resume the imports of Taiwan fowl.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan chicken and duck is exported mostly to Japan, accounting
for 80 percent of total exports, followed by exports to Hong Kong,
accounting for 10 percent. Exports to the Czech Republic account for
little.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which used to import chicken from Thailand, needs
to find alternative suppliers, since fowl in Thailand and mainland
China have became infected with avian flu, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"If necessary, the COA will send officials to Saudi Arabia to
sell the idea of importing Taiwan chickens," he said.

Players in the domestic stock market are
very optimistic about the market prospects, with a confidence index
on the bourse jumping by more than 200 percent recently, according to
the results of a survey made public on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out jointly by Shih Hsin University and Win
Win Weekly, using indices worked out by UBS Securities Investment
Advisory (Taiwan) Ltd., finds that the confidence level of local
investors toward the stock market rose from 32.85 points in December
to 106.82 points in February, an astounding rise of 224 percent.
</P>
<P>
Judging from a cross analysis, male players are more optimistic
than female players, while high-income people are more optimistic
than low-income workers, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the weighted index -- the key barometer of the
domestic bourse -- stood at 6932.17. points as of Wednesday, close to
a nearly four-year high of 7,000 points. Some 56 percent of the stock
market players polled think that now is a good time to buy shares.

According to Win Win Weekly Chairman Liang Yung-huang, the

GOVERNMENT PLANS TO DEMAND FINANCIAL GUARANTEE FOR MAINLAND SPOUSES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government is planning to ask Taiwan
residents to produce NT$5 million (US$151,050) as a financial
guarantee if they have a mainland Chinese spouse who wants to settle
in Taiwan, which is in line with the existing practice for foreign
spouses of Taiwan residents, a government spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chia-lung made the remarks after the Executive Yuan approved
revised regulations concerning the settlement or residency of
mainland Chinese people in Taiwan the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The revised regulations, in line with the Nationality Law, state
that mainland people wanting to settle or reside in Taiwan must meet
certain financial conditions, such as an average monthly income over
the past year of at least twice Taiwan's basic salary of NT$15,840
(US$477).
</P>
<P>
Failing that, the Taiwan spouses must provide evidence that they
have assets worth over NT$5 million so that they can provide for
their mainland spouses in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the measures worked out by the Ministry of the
Interior are "in line with international standards" and "will reduce
the burden on society, as well as protect the mainland spouses."
</P>
<P>
He said the measures "should not be considered as being hard on
the public."
</P>
<P>
However, the measures, if implemented, are bound to affect many
less wealthy Taiwan people who are considering marrying mainland
brides.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, foreign people who apply to become ROC citizens
have to meet the financial threshold according to the Nationality Law
and mainland spouses should be no exception.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, only those who apply to come to Taiwan for
settlement will be required to provide the NT$5 million financial
guarantee, while those who only come to Taiwan to be reunited with
their families will not be required to post such a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Noting that mainland spouses who come to Taiwan to settle will
enjoy social resources, welfare and benefits, Lin said that the
government has to make the revision based on the overall development
of society.
</P>
<P>
"The measures will also help prevent mainland spouses from
suffering in the event that the finances of their Taiwanese
dependents worsen."
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the revisions are based on "equal treatment" for
all people and are not aimed at "making it hard on people's rights to
marry."

President Chen Shui-bian endorsed the white paper, which was
drafted by the non-profit League of Welfare Improvement for Older
People (LWIOP) and passed at the national Silver-Haired Summit last
year, at the opening of the league's general meeting.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Chen said that he feels sorry
for the country's elderly for not having benefited from a
long-planned pension scheme.
</P>
<P>
If it had not been boycotted by the opposition parties, the
scheme would have taken force long before, with the abundant profits
generated from the public lottery over the past two years, Chen
claimed.
</P>
<P>
After Chen left, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng -- who
is also election campaign manager for Chen's rival, opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate, People First
Party Chairman James Soong -- arrived and endorsed the white paper on
Lien's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that at present, each of the country's senior citizens
receives NT$3,000 per month as a subsidy. The figure, he said, could
be raised to around NT$8,900 if the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of
Lien and Soong is elected in the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The LWIOP, a nationwide private organization established some 10
years ago to push for better welfare for senior citizens, had invited
both presidential rival sides to jointly endorse the welfare for the
elderly policies.
</P>
<P>
League officials said that regardless of which party wins the
election, welfare for the elderly should be bolstered rather than
compromised.
</P>
<P>
The LWIOP white paper provides 45 suggestions for the next
administration to implement. The suggestions include efforts to
respect the elderly, help the elderly lead independent lives,
facilitate their right to vote, and beef up services for them.

ORANGUTAN SENT TO U.K. UNDER COOPERATION PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport,  Taoyuan,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A
female orangutan was sent to Britain early Wednesday morning under a
great ape reproduction cooperation program between Taiwan and the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The red-haired primate, aged 12 and weighing 30 kilograms, was
handed over by zoologists from National Pingtung Technology
University (NPTU) to staff from Monkey World - Ape Rescue Center, a
aBritish primate conservation center, at the CKS International
Airport. The Monkey World personnel had traveled to Taiwan
exclusively for the purpose of taking the orangutan to her new home
in Britain.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines offered free transportation of the orangutan from
Taiwan to the United Kingdom to show its support for wildlife
conservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The NPTU shelter for abandoned wild animals, located in the
southern county of Pingtung, has plans in place dating back to 1999
to send a total of eight orangutans to Britain for reproduction and
related research. The plan is being carried out under the assistance
of the Council of Agriculture (COA) as part of a cooperative program
with Monkey World. As of the end of 2002, five orangutans and 11
gibbons have been sent to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The orangutan sent Wednesday was the sixth, according to Pei
Chia-chi, director of the NPTU shelter.
</P>
<P>
The NPTU shelter has also cooperated with its counterpart in
Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand by sending other great apes there
under a similar reproduction and research program.
</P>
<P>
More than a decade ago, according to Pei, a large number of
orangutans were smuggled into Taiwan to be sold as pets or for other
commercial purposes. However, many of the animals ended up being
deserted by their owners.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the COA has sponsored the return of 33 orangutans to
their native habitat in Borneo, Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Other abandoned apes have also been sent home to Thailand and
Malaysia over the past five years, Pei said, adding that some 20
abandoned orangutans are still being kept at the NPTU shelter for
wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Only about 140 of the Borneo orangutans in Taiwan are legally
registered with the government, although hundreds more have been
smuggled into Taiwan over the past decade, according to COA
officials.

RANKING WEF OFFICIAL TO VISIT TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  March 2 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Maria Eigueres, co-chief executive
officer of the Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF), is scheduled
to visit Taiwan March 7.
</P>
<P>
Figueres will be the highest-ranking WEF official to visit Taiwan
in recent years. The visit is expected to help enhance bilateral
exchanges between Taiwan and the influential international
organization.
</P>
<P>
Figueres' visit will be mainly about promoting the participation
of Taiwan enterprises in the WEF, and strengthening cooperation
between the WEF and Taiwan's academic organizations and think tanks.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Taiwan, Figueres is also scheduled
to attend two seminars and call on various government officials.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he will meet with Tsai Ching-yen, minister without
portfolio, and other officials in charge of high-tech development to
discuss competition in the high-tech sector and related issues.
</P>
<P>
The WEF is an independent international organization committed to
improving the state of the world, with its members being major
enterprises in the world.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Taiwan Power Company, VIA Technologies,Inc., and
Uni-President Enterprises Corp. are members of the WEF, while the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development has also
maintained cooperative ties with the WEF.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Taiwan's participation and cooperative ties
in the organization has been limited over the years, Taiwan's
government and academic circles have attached great importance to the
WEF's annual global competitiveness report, regarding it as an index
of Taiwan's overall development. In Taiwan's presidential race this
year, both candidates have on many occasions cited figures and
related information in the WEF report.
</P>
<P>
The WEF holds an annual conference at the Swiss ski resort of
Davos. The conference is considered one of the most important world
forums. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, more than 30 heads of
state, and more than 100 ministerial officials attended this year's
gathering. However, Taiwan has been absent from the conference for
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Figueres, the former Costa Rican president, has visited Taiwan
several times during which he expressed that he was quite impressed
by Taiwan's economic and technological development and that he made a
lot of friends on the island.
</P>
<P>
Shen Lyushun, head of Taipei Representative Office in Geneva
since last May, invited Figueres to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Ching-yen, while heading a delegation to attend a World
Summit on the Information Society at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva
last December, called on Figueres, who serves as chief of a U.N.
panel on information and communication technology, and also invited
him to visit Taiwan.

TAIWAN TO PURCHASE SIX PATRIOT PAC-3 MISSILE BATTERIES: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will purchase six Patriot PAC-3
missile batteries from the United States under a 10-year weaponry
system procurement plan, a high ranking Ministry of National Defense
(MND) official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the six Patriot PAC-3 batteries -- among the
priorities in the NT$500 billion (US$15.06 billion) 10-year weaponry
system procurement plan -- is scheduled to be fulfilled in 15 years
beginning next year, Vice Minister of Defense Chen Chao-min said at
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Reporting on the 10-year procurement plan at the Legislative Yuan
Committee of National Defense Affairs, Chen said that while the exact
price of the six Patriot batteries is still under negotiation, the
execution of related budget is scheduled to begin in 2005, adding
that all the six missile batteries are expected to be delivered and
deployed before 2119.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year procurement plan is aimed at building an anti-missile
system for Taiwan while bolstering the island's retaliatory
capabilities in the face of the increasing missile threat from
mainland China, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The deputy defense minister said that possible attacks by
mainland Chinese submarines or guided missiles are the two greatest
threats to Taiwan's security.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the 10-year weaponry system procurement plan is a set
MND policy which will not be affected by the results of the
referendum scheduled to be held on the day of the presidential
election March 20.
</P>
<P>
One of the two referendum questions is whether Taiwan should
strengthen its anti-missile defense capabilities if mainland China
refuses to remove its deployed missiles aimed at the island.

Kaohsiung,  March  4  (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian formally
assumed the rotating chairmanship of the Council of Asian Liberals
and Democrats (CALD) at a changeover ceremony held in the southern
city of Kaohsiung Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who serves concurrently as chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), succeeded Sukhumbhand Paribatra,
a member of the Thai Parliament and of the Democrat Party. The DPP
term as CALD chair will end on Dec. 31, 2005 and will be succeeded by
the Liberal Party of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Chen said that his taking up the CALD
chairmanship represents not only an honor but also a responsibility
for the 23 million people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that last Saturday, around two million Taiwan residents
participated, with a joyful mood, in a "hand-in-hand" activity to
form a 500-kilometer human chain throughout the island to express
their strong desire of pursuing peace and democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, I am very glad to see so many CALD partners from
Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Cambodia,
Singapore and Sri Lanka get together in Kaohsiung to form another
'chain of democracy and freedom,'" Chen added.
</P>
<P>
"As a CALD rotating chairman, " Chen pointed out, "I will do my
utmost to achieve three goals -- expanding the organization's scale
and interactions among member parties, establishing a platform for
exchanges of views on democracy, freedom and human rights, and
boosting the partnership between the CALD and other global
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that he will join hands with the CALD, the
Liberal International (LI) and other democratic foundations in the
United States and Germany to forge a global alliance to help promote
democratization and human rights improvement in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The DPP is a co-founding member of the CALD, which was founded in
1993 to promote regional peaceful development and economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
A three-day meeting of the CALD executive committee opened in
Kaohsiung Thursday. While here, all meeting participants will also
call on several ranking government officials and visit the DPP
campaign headquarters in Kaohsiung to gain a better understanding of
campaign techniques. President Chen is seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, LI is also holding an Asian forum in conjunction with
the CALD conference, with over 100 representatives from 30-odd
countries participating.
</P>
<P>
LI is a London-based organization that groups more than 80
liberal democratic parties in 63 countries around the world. The DPP
formally joined the alliance in 2002. As an organization very
friendly toward Taiwan, LI has adopted a resolution to support
Taiwan's entry into the World Health Organization.

In order to hold its own against competition from other
countries, Taiwan needs to boost its competitiveness. That means
better education for its people, and that is why the Democratic
Progressive Party government has gone out of its way to ensure the
country's education system can turn out people who can meet the
challenges of today, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He urged his audience to join hands with the government to
improve the education system and teaching content.

FIRST LADY FILES LIBEL SUIT AGAINST FUGITIVE TYCOON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-chen filed a libel suit
against a fugitive tycoon Thursday after he told local news media
that he had used her to funnel undeclared campaign funds before her
husband, Chen Shui-bian, was elected president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The wheelchair-bound first lady said after filing the suit
against former Tuntex Group Chairman Chen You-hao with the Taipei
District Court that she doesn't like suing people.
</P>
<P>
"But whenever there is an election, there will be these smear
campaigns. If I keep quiet, it may look as if I am conceding, " Wu
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Chen You-hao, who fled Taiwan in 2002 while awaiting trial on
charges of embezzling corporate funds, claimed in media interviews in
San Francisco earlier this week that he can prove he handed a total
of NT$6 million in under-the-table donations to Wu in 1994 when her
husband was running for Taipei mayor and in 2000 for the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Wu said she feels deep regret that Chen You-hao has repeatedly
claimed that she had taken NT$6 million from him. "I've repeatedly
said I did not, but he still continues the false accusations against
me. I cannot but take the case to the court to clear my name."
</P>
<P>
Wu recalled another negative campaign when her husband was
running for re-election in the 1998 Taipei mayoral race. Rumors
circulated that her husband secretly visited Macau to solicit
prostitutes when in fact he was on a visit to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so sad about our election culture," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's suit marked the second time the first lady has filed a
defamation case during this presidential campaign. She filed a
slander suit against Lien Chan in January after the opposition
presidential candidate hinted the president's wealth was accumulated
through corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yu-hao's accusations are the latest in a series of
allegations by the former head of the financially troubled Tuntex
Group. He published several open letters in local newspapers in early
February saying two of the president's aides had taken undeclared
donations from him without giving a receipt during the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
President Chen, locked in a close race with his sole challenger
Lien Chan for the March 20 presidential election, has denied all of
Chen You-hao's accusations, saying they are an attempt by the
opposition to discredit him and undermine his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
Chen You-hao used to be an influential businessman during former
President Lee Teng-hui's era. His Tuntex Group was involved in a
number of lines of business, including textiles, cement,
construction, petrochemicals, travel and telecommunications. His
business empire failed in the late 1990s due in part to a botched
land development project. He has been indicted on charges of breach
of trust and corporate funds embezzlement. He has been put on a list
of Taiwan's most wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as a new "political refugee, " Chen You-hao
said in his open the letters published earlier that he began to doubt
President Chen's promise to wipe out corrupt "black gold" politics
after having "close dealings" with two of President Chen's confidants
-- Chen Che-nan, who is now a Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general, and Chang Ching-sen, an incumbent vice chairman of
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).
</P>
<P>
Chen You-hao claimed that he had offered bribe money to both Chen
Che-nan and Chang Ching-sen in exchange for their assistance in
resolving his business group's debt problems.
</P>
<P>
Both Chen Che-nan and Chang Ching-sen dismissed the allegations
as lies and filed separate libel suits against Chen You-hao with the
Taipei District Court on Thursday afternoon.

OPPOSITION SEEKING MERGER OF TAIPEI CITY, TAIPEI COUNTY, KEELUNG CITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition "pan-blue alliance" legislators
launched a campaign Thursday to seek the merger of Taipei City,
Taipei County and Keelung City through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Legislators of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party
(PFP) said they will start collecting the necessary endorsement
signatures immediately, in the hope of staging the referendum vote
alongside the legislative election at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Legislators Hung Hsiu-chu, Chou Hsi-wei, Lee Hung-chun and Huang
Teh-fu from the two largest opposition parties made their
announcement in a press conference held at the alliance's
presidential campaign office.
</P>
<P>
They compared the size and the populations of Taipei and such
metropolises as New York, London, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai, and made
the claim that only through a merging of Taipei City, Taipei County
and Keelung County into a "greater Taipei with an international
airport and harbor" can it become on a par with world metropolises
and have an international competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Both Huang and Lee noted that Taipei City and County have
quarrelled frequently over such things as water resources of the
Feitui reservoir and more recently over the contaminated waters in a
Hsintien community.
</P>
<P>
But the lives of the residents of the city and county are closely
intertwined, they added, whether in going to school or work.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that when the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) Yu Ching served as Taipei county magistrate, he and
President Chen Shui-bian, who was at that time Taipei mayor, had
talked about cooperating. President Chen also talked about sharing
prosperity with current DPP Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang,
but the talks have not produced substantive results, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Only through the merger can the basic problems be solved and
resources integrated," they claimed.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Huang Teh-fu said that the DPP and Su have long
advocated that Taipei County be upgraded to a special municipality
but the idea is still a pipe dream after four years.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei, elected from Taipei County, accused
Su of not seeking benefits for county residents and claimed that only
if Taipei County and Keelung City are upgraded to a
special municipality can national resources be evenly distributed.
</P>
<P>
The proposed referendum will ask the people if they agree that to
promote the balanced development of Taipei City, Taipei County, and
Keelung City, expand regional self-rule and establish a world-class
metropolis, Taipei City, Taipei County and Keelung city should be
merged and upgraded into a municipality.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP started the signature-collecting operation through
the lawmakers and local party branches. They said they would first
collect 0.5 percent of the names needed to propose the referendum.
After a screening committee under the Executive Yuan passes the
review, they would try to collect the signatures of 5 percent of the
electorate to establish the referendum.
</P>
<P>
"The promotion of a merger of Taichung City and County, and of
Kaohsiung City and County through referendum will also start soon, "
he said.

FIRST-PHASE WATER RESTRICTIONS COULD BE LIFTED: WRA

<P>
If the rainfall in March reaches the
average level for the same period of previous years, the government
will consider lifting the first-phase water restrictions that have
been in place for the past several months, Chen Shen-hsien, director
of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, disclosed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to three consecutive days of rain, the Feitsui reservoir
-- the major source of water for the greater Taipei area -- has
received 72 millimeters of rainfall since March 1, while the Shihmen
reservoir, the main source for the Taoyuan area -- has received 45
millimeters, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the rainfall received by the two reservoirs has
reached one-third of the average level of rainfall for the same
period of previous years and added that if both reservoirs continue
to receive sufficient rainfall for the rest of the month, the WRA
will discuss the possibility of lifting the first-phase water
restrictions in early April.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase water restrictions in place in the Taipei-Taoyuan

FOREIGN JOURNALISTS COMING TO COVER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 400 foreign journalists have
applied to cover the March 20 presidential election and the
first-ever nationwide referendum to be held simultaneously,
government sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the international community has
traditionally paid great attention to Taiwan's presidential
elections. This time around, the sources said, international society
has shown even more concern about the election as a result of the
controversial referendum.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all major foreign news organizations have filed
applications to cover the election, the sources said, adding that
journalists intending to cover the event include correspondents
stationed at U.N. headquarters, in mainland China, in Japan and in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The sources said 711 foreign journalists covered Taiwan's
first-ever direct presidential election in 1996, when mainland China
lobbed missiles and conducted live-fire military exercises on
Taiwan's doorstep in an attempt to influence the election result. In
2000, 600-plus foreign reporters traveled to Taiwan to cover the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A Government Information Office (GIO) official said that the
number of foreign newsmen applying to cover the hotly contested
election will continue to increase in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The results of many public opinion polls show that the race
between the ticket of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong is still too close
to call.
</P>
<P>
The GIO official said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and
the GIO have jointly worked out a common itinerary for all arriving
foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
According to the itinerary, the foreign press corps will visit
the Chen-Lu campaign headquarters March 16 and the Lien-Soong
campaign headquarters March 17.
</P>
<P>
On March 18, they will be offered the chance to interview
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen. The presidential
election, the referendum and cross-Taiwan Strait relations are
expected to be the main focus of the interview.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon of election day, the press group will be taken
to the Central Election Commission to observe the vote-counting
process.
</P>
<P>
The following day, a seminar will be held for foreign journalists
and local academics to discuss the outcome of the election and the
referendum results.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MOFA said it has invited the Association of Asian
Election Authorities (AAEA) to organize a delegation to Taiwan to
observe the election and witness the ROC's progress in political
democratization and electoral system advancement.
</P>
<P>
The AAEA was formed in 1997 to promote and institutionalize open
and transparent elections, independent and impartial election
authorities, the professionalization of Asian election authorities,
citizen participation in the electoral and civic process, information
sharing and the development of resources for election-related
information and research.

<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) has
decided to mobilize more rescuers to help three dolphins presently
living in the Tamshui river back to sea after being alerted that the
health of the trio might be deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Taipei residents first reported the dolphins Feb. 11 near the
Kuandu bridge. Taipei city and county authorities, as well as Taiwan
Cetacean Society, immediately joined hands to track down the
dolphins.
</P>
<P>
COA Vice Chairman Tai Cheng-yao said that the three dolphins have
now moved into the upper reaches of the river. Members of the Taiwan
Cetacean Society who got close to the animals have identified them as
rough-toothed dolphins that might have gone astray while pursuing
fish, as they appeared healthy at that time.
</P>
<P>
The city government invited officials from the COA, the county
government and wildlife protection groups to discuss the matter at a
meeting and concluded that they should observe and record the
dolphins' behavior and refrain from any follow-up action to avoid
disturbing them. Two other meetings were held.
</P>
<P>
Society members then reported that the dolphins, instead of
moving toward the sea, had actually traveled upstream about 10
kilometers from the mouth of the Tamsui river.
</P>
<P>
The city government held another meeting March 2 in which experts
concluded that the dolphins had been in the river for too long and
that their health will deteriorate unless they are rescued without
delay.
</P>
<P>
The COA held a fifth meeting Thursday and decided to enlist the
council, Taipei city and county governments in the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
As such a rescue attempt is without precedence in the world, the
COA has requested support from the coast guard, the military and the
Tamsui Fishermen's Association to try to minimize the risk to the
animals.

<P>
The government hopes that some Taiwan
cities can make it onto the list of the top five cleanest cities in
the world with more recycling and less garbage generated, a
government official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shih-fang, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, made the
remarks when she presided over a seminar in Taichung, central Taiwan.
Attending the meeting were local and central government environmental
officials and grassroots street-cleaning chiefs.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Liu expressed the hope that all
relevant agencies will work toward the goal set by the Environmental
Protection Administration, which has designated 2004 as "full
recycling and zero waste-dumping year."
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that in the 1960s and 1970s it was fairly common to see
large amounts of garbage dumping alongside rivers. But after years of
efforts, she claimed, recycling efforts have effectively reduced such
dumping.
</P>
<P>
She said that the concept of garbage disposal must be changed
from end-stage disposal to the cutting of garbage generation at the
source and that partial recycling will be expanded to full recycling
to help create cleaner and more beautiful cityscapes.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, if everyone on the island works with the
environmental authorities, there will be a chance for some cities to
become among the top five cleanest cities in the world.

EVA Airways opened a full cargo service
between Taipei and Osaka Thursday in an effort to provide more
comprehensive services in Northeast Asia, according to a spokesman
for the Taipei-based aviation company.
</P>
<P>
EVA Air uses B747-400 cargo planes on the once-weekly route every
Thursday in the initial stage, enabling the carrier to transport 340
tons of cargo between the two cities per week in conjunction with its
additional cargo capacity coming from existing passenger flights, the

</P>
<P>
EVA Air will in the future consider increasing its service on the
route in cooperation with a Japanese carrier through code-sharing,
depending on market demand, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Taipei-Osaka cargo service is the beginning of
the Taiwan's second-largest carrier launch of full cargo business to
a Japanese destination and it forms part of the airline's efforts to
set up a global cargo transport network, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Biotech products, electronics parts and components, as well as
car accessories and fresh agricultural and farm produce form the bulk

Sixteen mainland Chinese people who were
seized earlier this year for illegally entering the Taiwan-held
frontline island of Kinmen, smuggling contraband goods or poaching
were repatriated back to mainland China Thursday.

province of Fujian, which lies close to Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
Two mainland fishing boats sailed to Kinmen early in the morning
to take back the illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen coast guard authorities said they hope the Immigration
Bureau under the National Police Administration will set up a special
detention center in Kinmen as soon as possible to accommodate illegal
mainland immigrants and handle repatriation work.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Kinmen coast guard has to handle detention and
repatriation affairs in cooperation with the Kinmen branch of the Red
Cross Society.

"Overcrowding has become a major headache as we have only limited
space to accommodate detained illegal mainland immigrants, " a coast
guard official said, adding that 22 illegal mainland immigrants are
still being held at Kinmen coast guard headquarters awaiting
repatriation.

U.S. WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN EARLY RESUMPTION TO CROSS-STRAIT TALKS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 5 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior U.S. State Department official
said Thursday that whoever wins Taiwan's presidential election,
Washington would like to see an early resumption to talks between
Taipei and Beijing, according to a report by Hong Kong-based Phoenix
TV.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Randall G. Shriver, deputy assistant
secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, made the
comments while attending a hearing held by the East Asia and Pacific
Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations to examine Hong Kong's state of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that Beijing should pay attention to the will of the
Hong Kong people, Shriver said that the United States and other Asian
countries are concerned about mainland China's policy in dealing with
its special administration zone's affairs.
</P>
<P>
Talking about cross-strait relations, the official said that
whoever wins the presidency in Taiwan, the United States hopes to see
progress made in the resumption of talks between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
The island is set to hold its presidential election March 20,
with a national referendum also scheduled to be held the same day.
</P>
<P>
U.S. foreign policy treats Taiwan and Hong Kong as two different
issues, Shriver said. Although the policies are guided by Congress,
with some policies decided by U.S. law, he said, the relationship
that Washington can develop with Hong Kong is quite different from
the relationship that it can develop with Taiwan.

PARTICIPANTS OF LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL MEETING SUPPORT REFERENDUM

Taipei,  March 5 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Participants of the Liberal International
Asian Conference being held in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, expressed
their support Friday for Taiwan's planned referendum to be held March
20 alongside the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In discussion sessions on the role of political parties in
consolidating democracy and public participation, the participants
said that the holding of referendums allows the people to directly
make decision on public affairs. It is a universal value of direct
democracy, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's March 20 referendum will further cement the country's
democracy, they claimed.
</P>
<P>
Boris Dittrich, a Dutch parliamentarian and chairman of the D66
party, said that referendum is normal practice in a democratic
society and a very important mechanism. It is very popular and has
been frequently practiced around the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lili Nabholz-Haidegger, a member of the Swiss Liberal Democratic
Party and a member of the European Parliament, said that the holding
of a referendum is a symbol of a free and democratic nation. She
suggested that the people of Taiwan should appreciate their first
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, deputy secretary-general of Taiwan's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that the March 20 referendum
initiated by President Chen Shui-bian is the first of its kind in the
country's history and will mark a milestone in Taiwan's democratic
development.
</P>
<P>
Chen has placed two questions on the referendum: Should the
government buy new anti-missile systems to counter the growing
mainland Chinese missile buildup? And should the government open
talks with Beijing to establish a framework for cross-Taiwan Strait
peace and stability interaction?
</P>
<P>
The LI is holding an Asian forum in conjunction with the
conference of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats (CALD) in
Kaohsiung, with over 100 representatives from 29 countries around the
world participating.
</P>
<P>
LI is a London-based organization that groups more than 80
liberal democratic parties in 67 countries around the world. The DPP
formally joined the alliance in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which opened Thursday, will run through March 6.
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh hosted a dinner cruise on the city's Love
River Friday evening to entertain the participants.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who doubles as DPP chairman, assumed the rotating
chairmanship of the CALD Thursday at the opening ceremony of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu gave a keynote speech to the meeting
Friday, in which she said that Taiwan will continue to play an
indispensable role in defending peace and democracy in the future and
urged the world not to tolerate the mainland Chinese missiles aimed
at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien urged foreign
friends of Taiwan to support its campaign against the mainland
Chinese missile threat and its pursuit of peace in the Taiwan Strait.

at a local hotel, in which 45 research reports will be presented.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Taiwan has held such an international
orchid expo and it is also the first time for the APOC to be held by
a country that is not and an APOC member.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile that day, Taiwan orchids, out of a total of 5,000
submissions in a competition held at the venue, won the championship
and the top prizes in all sub-division group contests.
</P>
<P>
The exposition venue is in a recently completed 23-hectare
compound that will form the first part of a planned 200-hectare
first-ever biotechnology park in Taiwan designed specifically to be
one of the world's leading orchid cultivation facilities, which will
create a competitive mechanism for Taiwan's production, marketing,
research and sales of the popular flowers in the global market.

PREMIER: VICE PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT SERVE CONCURRENTLY AS PREMIER
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be inappropriate for the vice
president to serve concurrently as the premier, Premier Yu Shyi-kun
said at the Legislative Yuan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing an opinion of the Council of Grand Justices, the premier
said that although the Constitution does not prohibit the scenario,
putting the Executive Yuan under the charge of the vice president
would be inconsistent with the original intention of the
Constitution, which is to provide separate jobs for the vice
president and the premier.
</P>
<P>
"If the vice president can be put in charge of the Executive
Yuan, why not the president -- who is head of the whole country and
would be a more appropriate choice for chief of the Executive Yuan
than the vice president? " Yu asked rhetorically to stress his
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in response to Legislator Lee Chen-nan of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, who asked Yu his opinion on
the voices among opposition Kuomintang lawmakers asking James Soong,
who is running as KMT Chairman Lien Chan's running mate in the March
20 presidential election, to promise that he will not double as
premier if elected. Soong rejected the demand.

PREMIER VISITS LEGISLATIVE REFORM ACTIVISTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun paid a visit to a group
of demonstrators in front of the Legislative Yuan Friday to show his
support for a proposal to halve the number of legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, led by Lin Yi-hsiung, a former chairman of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), launched a 240-hour relay
fast in the legislature courtyard Monday to push for the passage of a
constitutional amendment bill before the March 20 presidential
election, to pave the way for the much-anticipated reduction in the
number of legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
Yu arrived at the demonstration site at noon and shook hands with
Lin and other legislative reform activists to show his regard and
support for them.
</P>
<P>
He also signed a petition jointly initiated by Lin and Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh demanding that the number of seats be
halved.
</P>
<P>
Noting that legislative reform has been a long-term goal of the
DPP, Yu said he hopes lawmakers of different political stripes can
work together to realize this goal as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the 2001 legislative election campaign, Yu recalled that
candidates from across the political spectrum backed the legislative
downsizing proposal.
</P>
<P>
"More than two years have passed; the proposal remains on the
drawing board, " Yu lamented, adding that he hopes the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP), which controls a majority in the legislature, will take
concrete action to deliver on their promises to halve the number of
legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
According to the existing regulations, legislative downsizing
requires amendments to the Constitution. Although the legislature has
formed a special committee in charge of Constitution-amending
affairs, the committee has yet to call its first meeting.
</P>
<P>
Former DPP Chairman Lin and Academia Sinica President Lee will
hold a joint news conference Saturday to expound on their appeal for
legislative downsizing as a first step toward legislative reform.
They want the legislature to pass a relevant constitutional amendment
proposal before the March 20 presidential poll to speed up the
legislative reform procedures.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day sit-in relay fast, organized by the Nuke-4 Referendum
Initiative Association (Nuke-4 RIA) , is being conducted in 24-hour
shifts. Most of the demonstrators are opponents of the island's
controversial fourth nuclear power plant now under construction in
Taipei County.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Nuke-4 RIA's present campaign is aimed at
promoting the establishment of a more refined political culture
characterized by honesty and credibility, Lin said he hopes all
domestic political figures will faithfully honor their campaign
promises.
</P>
<P>
Two legislators from the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, Chen
Chien-ming and Hsu Teng-kung, threw their support behind Lin's
campaign Friday by joining the peaceful relay fast.

MAC KEEPING CLOSE WATCH ON NPC MEETING IN BEIJING: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) is keeping a close watch on the developments in two important
meetings being held in Beijing, a senior official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference, MAC Vice Chairman Chen
Ming-tung said that even though Taiwan affairs are not a focus of the
ongoing second plenary session of the 10th National People's Congress
(NPC) -- mainland China's rubber-stamp parliament -- and the annual
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Beijing
leadership will be sure to take advantage of the two events to try to
sway Taiwan voters ahead of the March 20 presidential election and
its first-ever referendum.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's offer to
resume dialogue with Taiwan under the "one-China" principle in his
administrative report to the NPC delivered earlier in the day, Chen
said the biggest obstacle to cross-Taiwan Strait rapprochement lies
in Beijing's refusal to recognize the Republic of China's existence
as an independent sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Beijing's "one-China" principle, which downgrades
Taiwan to a province under mainland jurisdiction, is unacceptable,
Chen said that only when the mainland is willing to face up to the
ROC's existence pragmatically and recognize the people of Taiwan's
commitment and determination to pursue peace can the two sides of the
strait forge constructive interaction.
</P>
<P>
Touching on reports by pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily Sing Tao
Jihpao that the mainland has secretly stepped up its military
deployment against Taiwan, Chen said he was not surprised by the Sing
Tao reports because Beijing has long listed Taiwan's indefinite
postponement of negotiations for unification as one of the five
conditions under which it might use force to take over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that the mainland's saber-rattling and military
threats are the reasons behind President Chen Shui-bian's decision to
hold a referendum March 20 alongside the election.
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked two questions in the referendum -- whether
Taiwan should buy more anti-missile batteries in the face of the
mainland missile threat and whether Taiwan should negotiate a viable
mechanism with Beijing for cross-strait peaceful interaction.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Taiwan has no intention of igniting a cross-strait arms
race. "But we must beef up our defense capabilities, as Beijing still
refuses to renounce the option of using force against Taiwan, " he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen went on, war cannot resolve cross-strait
issues. "This is the rationale of the second question to be asked in
the referendum. The government hopes to obtain a mandate to negotiate
with Beijing for peaceful cross-strait engagements."
</P>
<P>
Chen urged the mainland authorities to understand the
significance of the referendum and to respect Taiwan's desire for
peace, stability and prosperity.

TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES GROWING FAST

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves had
snowballed to a record high of US$224.803 billion as of the end of
February, up by US$9.877 billion from the end of January, the Central
Bank of China (CBC) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to CBC statistics, the increase also represents a
historic monthly rise, helping Taiwan maintain its position as the
world's third-largest holder of foreign exchange reserves behind only
Japan and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
CBC officials attributed the increase to a huge influx of foreign
capital -- some US$1.5 billion in February -- and an appreciating new
Taiwan dollar. However, they warned that the foreign capital funneled
into Taiwan could be remitted out at any time.
</P>
<P>
Japan held US$776.857 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves
as of the end of February, ahead of the mainland in second place with
US$415.72 billion posted in late January.

South Korea held US$163.007 billion in foreign exchange reserves

</P>
<P>
In a brief ceremony, the president decorated the 99-year-old
elder with the Order of Propitious Clouds with Grand Cordon to honor
his contribution to society.
</P>
<P>
Born in Haining County, Zhejian province in 1906, Elder Ying Shun

Ying Shun was known for lodging in his temple in Hualien a young
runaway woman in 1963 and made her an apostle named Cheng Yen who

SUPPORT GROWS FOR FAST RELAY TO DRUM UP SUPPORT FOR HALVING LAWMAKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
Government officials, legislators and
scholars visited the participants of a 240-hour fast relay activity
Friday, which was in its fifth day to drum up support for the halving
of the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yi-hsiung, former chairman of the now-ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , and activists of the Nuke-4 Referendum
Initiative Association (Nuke-4 RIA) started the 240-hour fast relay
March 1, with each team fasting for 24 hours over a 10-day period.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Society North, Taiwan Society Central, Taiwan Society
South, Taiwan Society East, the Taiwan Association of University
Professors, legislators Lo Chi-ming and Chen Chien-ming of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union as well as Premier Yu Shyi-kun came to the
pedestrian walkway in front of the Legislative Yuan to greet the
participants and lend support to their cause.
</P>
<P>
After the visit, representatives from the Taiwan Association of
University Professors and the four societies held a press conference
during which they said that if the ruling and opposition camps cannot
reach a consensus before March 20, they will "follow the step of
Gandhi, and fight to the end using non-violent methods."
</P>
<P>
Wu Chien-kuo, office director of Nuke-4 RIA, urged full support
from the public for their campaign cause so as to prod the
legislature to take action.
</P>
<P>
"During this energetic presidential campaign, members of the
association have decided to use the most low key way of expression --
holding a sit-in and abstaining from food and talking to express the
voice of the public," Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all parties promised to cut the number of legislative
seats three years ago, Wu said they should honor their words to help
end the current chaotic situation in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to throw their support behind the cause,
noting that they should use every possible way to prod the political
parties and the legislators to deliver on their "cut in half"
promises.
</P>
<P>
"The promises should serve as a criterion to inspect whether a
political party or figure will honor their words," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yeh Po-wen, executive director of the Nuke-4 RIA, said that the
association called on the caucuses of various parties in the
legislature recently. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, agreed to do so.
</P>
<P>
But no legislators of the Kuomingtang and its ally, the People
First Party, have signed to express support for the proposal, Yeh
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the association does not want empty promise, but will ask
for action and results, hoping that every political party will ask
its members to strictly toe the party line so that a proposal to
amend the Constitution to cut the number of legislative seats can be
passed by the March 20 presidential election.

KAOHSIUNG FISHING-RELATED BUSINESSES SEEKING RELIEF FROM COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a deep sea, inshore and aquaculture
fishery stronghold in southern Taiwan, many related businesses based
in Kaohsiung are still mired in difficulties resulting from market
exploration and overseas sales, industry sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan's largest port city has long enjoyed fame thanks
to its handsome and diversified fish catches and aquaculture produce
such as eels and shrimps, sources from the local fishery industry are
concerned about sales and market exploration both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts made by the Kaohsiung City Government and
many related businesses to help local fishermen increase their
income, the sources said, for instance, that Taiwan-made frozen fish
products are facing robust competition from similar but cheaper goods
from mainland China and Southeast Asian countries in foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
In view of Taiwan's higher production coasts, Taiwan's related
businesses must further sharpen their competitiveness by varying
their products, enhancing their quality and using e-commerce
marketing networks to expand sales overseas and to edge into new
markets abroad, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
According to a frozen food processor operating in Kaohsiung,
frozen processed fish products have become more and more popular in
Taiwan because of the larger number of people who usually eat out.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the problem of chemical overuse by
some domestic fish raisers is really a big headache for them and has
dealt a blow to their businesses, as frozen food made of locally
raised fish were once detected to have contained excessive chemical
substances.
</P>
<P>
As one of the food processors who uses local raw materials, he
said they felt deeply frustrated over these problems. The frozen food
processor called on relevant government agencies to step up
management and control to wipe out the illegal drug use on natural
produce by some raisers to ensure greater security for the public.
</P>
<P>
At a time when many frozen fish processors headquartered in
Kaohsiung are seeking to expand into new foreign markets in mainland
China, Japan, the United States and the Middle East, the chemical
overuse issue is a big problem that all parties concerned cannot
afford to ignore.

More people were apprehended over the past
two days in the government's campaign to eliminate gambling on the
outcome of the March 20 presidential election, the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Leiting 30" campaign launched Wednesday to crack down
on underground gambling groups, particularly those applying the Hong
Kong horse racing lottery mechanism to offer bets, police have
arrested 149 people suspected of being involved in 135 cases of
illegal gambling over the election.

<P>
Last week, under the "Leiting 29" campaign, the police detained
242 people in 188 cases of illegal betting on the election, CIB
officials reported.

<P>
The CIB authorities were tipped off in the recent month that
wagers on the outcome of the presidential election have been rampant
islandwide, particularly in central and southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Betting, like other forms of gambling, is illegal in Taiwan and
betting on elections is especially rare. The "Leiting 29" and
"Leiting 30" drives were launched to stop underground gambling rings
from manipulating the presidential election by offering big stakes,
CIB officials said.

GOVERNMENT URGED TO SCRAP FINANCIAL GUARANTEE FOR MAINLAND SPOUSES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Dozens of mainland Chinese women married to
men from Taiwan took to the streets Friday along with women's rights
activists to protest the government's decision that "marriage
immigrants" must provide financial guarantees that the protesters say
are unreasonably high.
</P>
<P>
The groups handed an appeal to a representative of the Executive
Yuan, asking the government to repeal the new NT$5 million
(US$150,600) financial guarantee regulation for mainland Chinese
spouses applying for permanent residence or ROC citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Although the Ministry of the Interior made an abrupt policy
about-face Thursday on the regulation passed March 1 and lowered the
residence threshold to a much lower NT$380,160 (US$11,450) , the
demonstrators asked the government to scrap the regulation
altogether, calling it "a hostile and discriminatory immigration
policy."
</P>
<P>
Li Mingfang, 56, who came to Taiwan to live after marrying her
75-year-old Taiwan husband, said her family cannot afford the
financial guarantee, even if at a low of NT$380,160, given their
difficult financial situation with her NT$20,000 monthly income
working as a dishwasher and her husband being chronically ill.
</P>
<P>
Chao Yen-ning, a consultant to the Alliance for Human Rights
Legislation for Immigrants and Migrants, said that regardless of
whether the financial guarantee was NT$5 million or NT$380,160, it is
a regulation demanding certification of an account balance, which
would be seen as ridiculous in an advanced country.

The legislature and committee meetings will also recess between
March 13 and 19, Wang said, adding that the session will reopen after
the election.
</P>
<P>
But Ker Chien-ming, party whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said a floor meeting should not only screen the
political donations bill, but the political party bill, and the
revised financial reconstruction fund bill as well.
</P>
<P>
He also said that since all political parties have expressed the
desire to push for the halving of the 225-seat legislature, then the
coordination among all parties should at least be completed before
the legislature goes into recess.
</P>
<P>
The legislators will continue to discuss whether to recess and
what bills should screened next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuomintang (KMT) caucus in the legislature pointed
out that the "pan-green" camp, meaning the ruling DPP and its ally,
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), must take full responsibility for
the breakdown of the agreement and for the failure of the political
donations bill to clear the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Liao Feng-teh, KMT party whip in the legislature, said that the
"pan-blue alliance, " meaning the KMT and the People First Party,
reached an initial agreement with the "pan-green" camp, but the DPP
and the TSU later made changes to the original agreement.
</P>
<P>
Liao pointed out that the legislature had agreed to put the
discussion of the political donations bill on a priority list at the
March 12 floor meeting, but the "pan-green" camp added another two
bills -- the political party bill and the revised financial
reconstruction bill.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-green" camp also added that all parties should complete
the coordination process on halving the legislative seats, Liao
added.
</P>
<P>
He believed that because of the "technical boycott" by the
"pan-green" camp, it should take responsibility for the breakdown of
the agreement.

DPP WORRIED ABOUT POSSIBLE LOW VOTER TURNOUT IN UPCOMING REFERENDUM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday it is worried about a
possible low voter turnout in Taiwan's first-ever nationwide
referendum to be held March 20 alongside the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus made the remarks after a recent public
opinion poll found that only 33 percent of the respondents said they
would definitely cast ballots in the upcoming referendum.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey, conducted by SANLIH Entertainment
Television March 1-2, was aimed at exploring the support ratings of
the two presidential tickets and public opinion about the
controversial referendum. A total of 1,058 valid samples were
collected in the survey, with a margin of error of 3.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the respondents were divided about the
referendum, with 33.1 percent saying they will certainly go and vote;
11.4 percent saying they will probably cast ballots in the
referendum; 31.21 percent saying they will definitely not cast
referendum ballots; and 11.5 percent saying they will probably not
cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative whip Tsai Huang-lang said the findings were
worrisome as they indicated that local voters were not keenly
interested in the historic referendum.
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked two questions in the nation's first-ever
referendum -- whether Taiwan should buy more anti-missile batteries
in the face of mainland China's intensified military threat and
whether Taiwan should negotiate with mainland China for the
establishment of a viable mechanism for peaceful bilateral
interaction.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China has dismissed the referendum as a move to promote
Taiwan independence and Taiwan's major trading partners, including
the United States and Japan, have also expressed concern about the
vote.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said what the international community is concerned about is
the referendum results. "If less than 50 percent of eligible voters
cast ballots in the upcoming referendum, it will send the wrong
message -- that the people of Taiwan are not united in the face of
mainland China's missile threat. Should that be the case, it would be
a big flop for our country," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
As far as the presidential election is concerned, 36 percent of
those interviewed said they would vote for the DPP ticket of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, while 35.7
percent said they would vote for the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
ticket of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong, and 23.2 percent would not reveal their
choice.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the results, Tsai said he is optimistic about the
Chen-Lu ticket's re-election bid as its poll numbers have
consistently exceeded that of the Lien-Soong team. In terms of
previous experiences, Tsai said, about 70 percent of those who refuse
to disclose their support target were DPP core supporters.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Tsai said he is confident that the Chen-Lu
ticket will win.
</P>
<P>
By constituency, Tsai said, the Chen-Lu ticket lagged far behind
behind the Lien-Soong ticket in northern Taiwan, particularly in the
Hakka stronghold of the Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli area.
</P>
<P>
According to the SANLIH survey, the Lien-Soong support rating in
the Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli constituency reached 43.5 percent, far
higher than the Chen-Lu's 24.6 percent. And 31.9 percent remained
undecided.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that the Chen-Lu ticket enjoyed a comfortable
lead over the Lien-Soong ticket in central and southern Taiwan
constituencies. Tsai attributed this trend mainly to the historic
"hand-in-hand" rally on Feb. 28 when more than one million people held
hands to form a 500 kilometer human chain that stretched the length
of Taiwan.

TWO OF THREE DOLPHINS IN TAMSHUI RIVER RESCUED: OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March  5 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the three "stray" rough-toothed
dolphins that have been living in the Tamshui River over the past
three weeks have been captured, while the third remains "at large, "
officials from the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two captured dolphins, suffering from tilted dorsal fins,
were being transported to Sea World in Yeliu, Taipei County, as of
press time, for medical treatment and observation, COA authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
The COA authorities decided Thursday to mobilize more rescue
workers to help the trio of dolphins return to the sea after being
alerted that the health of the sea mammals might be deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Taipei residents first reported sightings of the dolphins Feb. 11
near the Kuandu Bridge. Taipei city and county authorities, as well
as Taiwan Cetacean Society officials, immediately joined hands to
track down the dolphins.
</P>
<P>
The city government invited officials from the COA, the county
government and wildlife protection groups to discuss the matter at a
meeting in February, and concluded that they should observe and
record the dolphins' behavior and refrain from any follow-up action
to avoid disturbing them.
</P>
<P>
The COA authorities and specialists from the Taiwan Cetacean
Society later decided after convening five meetings that the dolphins
must be captured and returned to where they came from before long.
The decision was based on considerations of the deteriorating health
of the dolphins and the fact that the animals seemed unable to find
their way back to sea.
</P>
<P>
The COA has also requested support from the coast guard, the
military, the Tamsui Fishermen's Association and even a Japanese
cetacean expert to try to minimize the risks to the dolphins in the
rescue efforts.

DOMESTIC PILOTS HOPE TO BE ALLOWED TO WORK IN MAINLAND CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An association representing Taiwan's pilots
has asked the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) to modify
regulations to allow local pilots to fly for mainland Chinese
carriers, a situation which is currently forbidden.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Chinese Pilots Association said that the
aviation industry in the mainland is expected to expand rapidly over
the next 20 years, and the number of civilian airplanes will increase
four fold from the current 500 to 2,000. Job opportunities in the
mainland look quite promising, they added.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the development of civil aviation in Taiwan has
stalled, and pilots have to find employment in a very limited market,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that aviation is an international enterprise and
that local pilots should not be confined to Taiwan, but must be
allowed to branch out internationally.
</P>
<P>
Under the current Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, local pilots are
prohibited from working in the mainland, association officials said.
</P>
<P>
They argued, however, that the nature of a pilot's work does not
undermine national security or interests. The association, therefore,
has applied to the CAA to devise a method by which Taiwan pilots
could fly for mainland carriers.
</P>
<P>
The CAA has yet to respond to the request, believing that
anything involving cross-Taiwan Strait affairs must be treated with
caution.
</P>
<P>
The association is in the process of determining how many Taiwan
pilots are interested in working in the mainland. The association has
distributed questionnaires to its members in this regard and the
survey is expected to be completed by March 10.

AEGIS-EQUIPPED WARSHIPS SALES TO TAIWAN UNDER CONSIDERATION: PENTAGON
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 5 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. Defense Department spokesman
said Friday that a newspaper was incorrect when it reported that the
Pentagon has agreed to sell warships equipped with the advanced Aegis
radar system to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Friday Washington Times report also said that it was the
first time that the Bush administration had agreed to the sale of
such advanced warships to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Pentagon spokesman said that selling warships
equipped with the advanced Aegis radar system to Taiwan is "still
under consideration" and that the Defense Department has not yet
approved such arms sales to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that even if the Pentagon agrees to sell the
warships, the sale would need a joint endorsement by the White House
Security Council, and the departments of state and defense.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that such arms sales could be
controversial since Aegis-equipped warships are the foundation of
U.S. anti-missile systems, which are expected to be deployed next
year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that because of mainland China's deployment of an
increasing number of missiles aimed at Taiwan, the island is anxious
to seek anti-missile defense weapons.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's defense authorities have long hoped to buy warships
equipped with the advanced Aegis radar system, but mainland China has
strongly opposed the sale because of concerns that the sale could
neutralize the deterrence of its missiles aimed at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also worries that a U.S. sale of such warships to Taiwan
could represent a reinforcement of military contacts and cooperation
between Taipei and Washington.

NEARLY 70 PERCENT OF TAIWAN PEOPLE FOR HALVING OF LEGISLATIVE SEATS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 6 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 70 percent of the people of Taiwan
support halving of the 225-seat Legislative Yuan, Lin Yi-hsiung, a
former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a press conference he jointly called with Lee
Yuan-tseh, president of Academia Sinica, Lin cited results of a poll
conducted by Focus Survey Research Feb. 28-29, saying that 68.1
percent of the respondents were in favor of cutting the number of
seats in the legislature, against 10.2 percent in opposition and 21.7
percent having no idea about the issue.
</P>
<P>
The poll, commissioned by Taiwan Thinktank, also showed that 58.4
percent of the respondents were not satisfied with the performance of
the Legislative Yuan over the past six months, while only 17.6
percent were satisfied with the law-making body's performance and 24
percent had no idea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 55.8 percent of the respondents believed that the
downsizing of legislature will help improve the lawmaker's
performance, against 16.9 percent of the pollees who took the
contrary position and 27.2 percent who had no idea.
</P>
<P>
Lin and Lee issued a joint statement Feb. 20, urging the two
presidential tickets to push lawmakers to pass a constitutional
reform bill ahead of the March 20 election to pave the way for
halving the number of legislative seats. They also called on the
general public to endorse their joint appeal.
</P>
<P>
Lin also started a 10-day fast relay March 1 together with
members of an anti-nuclear power group -- Nuke-4 Referendum
Initiative Association -- in front of the Legilstive Yuan building to
press for reduction of the number of legilative seats.
</P>
<P>
As of March 5, Lin said, a total of 35,563 individuals, including
President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Chu-wen, DPP Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung, 87 DPP legislators and 12 TSU lawmakers, had endorsed
their appeal.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yuan-tseh, co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in Chemistry,
called on the ruling and opposition parties to pass a constitutional
reform bill for halving the number of legislative seats by March 20.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the political party law, political donation law
and an amendement to the existing Election and Recall Law for
establishing a "single-seat constituency and two-vote system" should
be followed, he added.

LIEN-SOONG TICKET LEADING PRESIDENTIAL RACE: POLLS

<TEXT>
<P>
The ticket formed by opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate, People First Party Chairman
Janes Soong, is leading the upcoming presidential election by a
narrow margin, according to results of two polls published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The polls were conducted jointly by Shih Hsin University and a
marketing consultant company -- InsightXplorer Ltd. -- from Feb. 29
to March 1 by randomly selected telephone numbers and from Feb. 28 to
March 3 via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
If tomorrow were election day, 41.1 percent of the telephone
respondents and 42.6 percent of the Internet respondents said that
they would vote for the Lien-Soong ticket, while 37.5 percent and
34.4 percent were in favor of the ticket formed by incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, the surveys
showed.
</P>
<P>
With regard to who is likely to win the presidential race, 39.1
percent of the telephone respondents and 42.3 percent of the Internet
respondents chose the Lien-Soong ticket against 25.1 percent and 19.4
percent for the Chen-Lu ticket, respectively.

LIEN VOWS TO ESTABLISH CLEAN, CAPABLE GOVERNMENT IF ELECTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition presidential candidate Lien Chan
on Saturday vowed to establish a "clean, capable and professional
government" if elected in the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Lien made the remarks when he spoke in a 30-minute platform
presentation of the presidential candidates sponsored by the Central
Election Commission. Local terrestrial TV station China Television
Company carried the presentation live.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the largest opposition party, the Kuomintang,
said that he is committed to establishing a clean government, adding
that, "No one will be able to come to my house to ask for positions
or any special favors."
</P>
<P>
He also promised not to condone the actions of anyone,
"especially my subordinates, when there is evidence of criminal
wrongdoing against them, " alluding to the recent allegations by a
disgraced fugitive tycoon against the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, a ranking presidential aide and a Cabinet-level official.
</P>
<P>
If elected, he said, "I will donate my salary over the four-year
term and government subsides for presidential candidate to help
youngsters who can't afford to pay tuition, those who can't afford to
buy healthy lunches at school, and the elderly. This money will also
go to middle-to-low income families and the disabled who can't afford
to see doctors."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that this is not about money, Lien said that this will
be his way of telling himself that "being president is a social
service, and a president is one who has made up his mind to serve as
a volunteer."
</P>
<P>
Only by using this guideline can the presidential office avoid
becoming a conniving center for power and special interest groups,
and it is the way that Taiwan can be saved, Lien said.
</P>
<P>
On cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Lien said the basic stance of
his camp is that the Republic of China is an independent sovereign
country, and that cross-strait relations must be conducted under the
principles of "maintaining the status quo as well as Taiwan first."
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that insisting on the status quo is to safeguard
the dignity of the Taiwan people, so that Taiwan will not be
swallowed or unified by mainland China.
</P>
<P>
He also lashed out at his rival, incumbent President Chen
Shui-bian, for being fickle in his stance toward cross-strait
relations, wavering from his middle-of-the-road approach in 2000 to
the present "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait."
</P>
<P>
Turning to the national pension plan which his camp has promoted
for a long time, he said it should be put into practice in four years
to ensure that every citizen can live in dignity after retirement.
</P>
<P>
Before the system is put in force, he said that half of the
retirement payments for laborers will receive a premium deposit rate
of 18 percent according to his plan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he will promote a negative return tax system,
meaning that if the annual income of the people does not reach the
level of minimum income, the government will subsidize the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
His camp will also "promote ethnic equality and harmony, " and
those political figures who try to drive a wedge between ethnic
groups and polarized them will be disciplined according to the law,
Lien said.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to uphold and promote Hakka culture, establish a
world-class Hakka museum, increase budgets for the Cabinet-level
Council for Hakka Affairs, nurture and groom Hakka political talents
with the ratio of Hakka people in politics no less than the ratio of
Hakka people among Taiwan's total population.
</P>
<P>
He again promoted his ideal of a recruit system for the military,
saying that today's warfare has changed, and the focus should be put
on high-technology weaponry and high-quality military men.
</P>
<P>
As the strategy of the nation in the event of war is to defend
and to deter, he said the current military structure should be
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
He advocated that all conscripts, after three month of compulsory
military training, become reservists. On the other hand, around
120,000 soldiers, 80,000 officers and 50,000 cadets from all levels
of military schools will form a 250,000 force to receive more
comprehensive training and become a credible defense force.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recruitment and conscription systems should
co-exist in the beginning, but the recruitment system can begin in
2008 after the government passes the appropriate law and NT$60
billion (US$1.8 billion) budget this year.
</P>
<P>
On education, Lien vowed to increase its budget to 6 percent of
the gross national product from the present 4.39 percent, or up
NT$160 billion. Among the most important things is to protect the
rights of impoverished young men to receive an education, he added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Women's Day on March 8, Lien said that women would like
to see the nation develop and the jobless rate fall. They are also
interested in better social order and improving the education system,
he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to provide equality in the workplace, especially in
politics, so that the number of women nominees for government posts
or elections will be no less than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that the nation has come to a "threshold, " where the
president must take responsibility and deliver on his promises,
adding that "a second political power transfer must take place now"
to change the past and to provide hope to the nation.

ASIAN TRAVEL TO BECOME FASHIONABLE FOR TAIWAN TOURISTS AFTER ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outbound travel to destinations in Asian
countries will become fashionable among Taiwan tourists in the months
after the March 20 presidential election, sources from the domestic
tourist industry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources made the forecast on the grounds that regional travel
has long been a major market trend among Taiwan's outbound tourists
and that an avian flu that has affected many Asian countries is
fading.
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of an ongoing economic recovery after the most
recent recession resulting from the potentially deadly severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of last year, many
countries and areas in the region, such as Japan, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea have launched promotional
packages to lure foreign visitors, they added.
</P>
<P>
The sources said optimistically that outbound travel,
particularly travel in the Asian region, will regain popularity in
Taiwan, especially after the presidential race which has greatly
affected the local people's willingness to go abroad for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that outbound travel will immediately pick up once
the effects brought by the election are over, coupled with a rising
stock market and an improved business condition in many sectors.
</P>
<P>
Citing statistics, the sources said that the number of Taiwan's
outbound tourists peaked in 2002 at 7.36 million. Although the SARS
outbreaks led the number to drop by 20 percent for the whole of last
year, they added that the number of Taiwan people going abroad for
sightseeing rose noticeably in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Judging from bookings for airplane seats on outbound flights to
depart after March 20 that are almost full, they predicted that this
year's summer peak season is set to see a larger number of outbound
Taiwan tourists.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that it is worth noting that the domestic
travel market remains relatively unaffected by the economic situation
at home or abroad.
</P>
<P>
For instance, they said Taiwan people pay about 100 million
visits to domestic tourist spots or resort facilities per year,
creating an added value worth more than NT$500 billion (US$15
million).
</P>
<P>
As long as the government and the private sector cooperate in
building more qualified environments and provide more customized
services, public demand for domestic travel will undoubtedly further
go up, they said, adding that it is also a key strategy to attract a
larger number of foreign tourists to Taiwan at a time when the
government has unveiled its resolve to achieve such an aim by 2008.

PRESIDENT CHEN APPEALS TO VOTERS WITH SIX PROMISES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian appealed to voters
in a televised presentation of presidential candidates' political
views Saturday with six promises and listed four issues as top
priorities should he win re-election.
</P>
<P>
In a 30-minute televised speech, Chen said his first promise is
to insist on Taiwan's sovereignty and the country's own economic
identity.
</P>
<P>
In his second promise, the president said he is confident he can
bring the country into the World Health Organization within two
years.
</P>
<P>
The third was that the Taiwan issue has to be settled through
peaceful means. Chen promised to push for the establishment of a
peaceful and stable interaction framework with Beijing and normalize
Taiwan's ties with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In his fourth promise, the president reiterated his promise of
political reform featuring the creation of a new constitution via a
referendum by 2006 with the new constitution in place by 2008.
</P>
<P>
In the proposed new constitution, the government's power will be
shared among the executive branch, the legislative branch and the
judicial branch rather among than the current five branches, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the president rather than the premier will be the head of
the executive branch, and the number of legislators will be cut to
about half of the current 225. The government will be divided into
central and local levels. The legal age will be lowered from 20 to
18, and compulsory military service will be eliminated and replaced
with a professional armed forces, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In his fifth campaign promise, Chen said he hopes to achieve his
administration's economic goals, including achieving 5 percent
economic growth this year, driving the unemployment rate down to 4
percent next year, and boosting the country's total research and
development expenditure to 3 percent of gross domestic product by
2006.
</P>
<P>
Sixth, the president promised to continue various reforms in the
fields of education, finance, the judiciary, the legislature,
government and in society.
</P>
<P>
Notable among these reforms is a bill obligating political
parties to return illegally amassed assets, which will force the
Kuomintang to return to the country the real estate that it
expropriated, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The president also listed four priorities of his agenda for next
term, if he is re-elected, which are education, the economy, the
underprivileged, and the quality of people's lives. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his speech the president came to the defense of his
wife, Wu Shu-chen, who was put in the spotlight recently after being
accused by a former business tycoon of taking off-the-books political
donations from him.
</P>
<P>
Chen lauded his wife's courage and bravery especially when she
embarked on a visit to the United States in 2002 when she had just
undergone a medical procedure. The president said he was very anxious
when he learned at his Taipei office that his wife had collapsed in
Los Angeles, the last stop of her visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he is proud of his wife -- a woman who will do
whatever she can for the country, the president warned his critics
not to try to smear his wife in attempts to undermine his campaign,
because the public is not so easily fooled.

LAWMAKER CALLS FOR INTERIM BAN ON STEEL EXPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government should follow the example of
South Korea and impose an interim ban on steel exports to meet
surging demand at home, a lawmaker urged on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wei Ming-ku of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
made the call in a news release issued earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that price hikes have pushed some wholesalers to
stockpile their products, Wei said many downstream companies have
complained about the loss of business opportunities coming from a
booming housing market.
</P>
<P>
Many companies are afraid to take new orders out of fears of
unpredictable rising prices that have shown no signs of stopping
since China Steel Corp. -- the largest steel producer in Taiwan --
announced it would raise prices on Feb. 26, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wei called on the government to come up with a solution quickly
by following South Korea and halt steel exports ahead of Taiwan's
approaching presidential election. Otherwise, steel businesses may
take to the streets, a situation which the lawmaker warned may affect
the result of the March 20 election.

LABOR GROUPS PRESS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR BETTER LABOR POLICY

<TEXT>
<P>
Several labor groups said Saturday they
will make a public appeal to press candidates in the ongoing
presidential race to create a better labor policy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wei-jen, president of the Alliance of Taiwan Unemployed
Workers, said at a news conference Saturday that he and leaders of
several other labor groups will make a public appeal in front of the
Presidential Office and the Legislative Yuan from March 15 to March
17 to press for a better labor policy from President Chen Shui-bian
and his rival in the presidential race, Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some labor groups have called for their members to
boycott the March 20 election to show their displeasure with both
candidates, Wang said people, especially those who are out of work,
will be ignored if they are absent from the election.

<P>
Instead of watching from the sidelines, Wang said, workers should
flex their political muscle by calling for both candidates to come up

He called on President Chen and KMT chief Lien to unveil before

TAICHUNG AIRPORT SHOULD BOOST AIR TRAVEL TO EASTERN TAIWAN, ISLANDS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite strong public skepticism over the
market prospects and the security of the newly opened airport at
Chingchuankang in Taichung, central Taiwan, various domestic carriers
are optimistic about air travel business from central Taiwan to
eastern regions and outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
Both UNI Airways Corp. and Mandarin Airlines -- the only two
aviation companies that have set up service counters at
Chingchuankang Airport -- said that they are confident of good
business, although a high-speed railway system under construction is
slated to start operations next year.
</P>
<P>
The operations of the north-south high-speed railway will
undoubtedly deal a blow to Taipei-Taichung air travel, but the
railway system will cause no impact on the air travel market from
central Taiwan to eastern Hualien, Taitung and various outlying
islands because of their tourism potential, officials of the two
aviation companies said.
</P>
<P>
According to UNI Airways officials, a special air-sea transport
package designed by the carrier to help mainland-based Taiwan

it also runs 14 flights from Taichung to the frontline island of
Kinmen each day.

<P>
UNI Airways also conducts the Taichung-Makung (on Penghu Island)

Although many people have had doubts over the future and what

Meanwhile, one of the three historic charter flights organized by
the Taichung Chamber of Commerce (TCC) in cooperation with China
Airlines to mark the airport's opening left from Taichung for Tokyo
Friday morning and arrived at Narita Airport later the same day with
158 passengers.
</P>
<P>
TCC Chairman Lai Cheng-i said he strongly believes that the
airport will give a boost to central Taiwan's tourism and traffic
development and he expressed the hope that it could launch regular
commercial flights as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The airport, which recently completed its first phase of
construction, will only handle domestic and outbound charter flights
in the initial stage despite its status as an international airport.

VICE PRESIDENT ASKS FORMER TUNTEX BOSS TO PROVE ALLEGATIONS

<P>
Vice President Annette Lu on Saturday said
that Chen Yu-hao, a fugitive business tycoon, should come forward
with concrete evidence to support his recent allegations against
President Chen Shui-bian, the first lady and some officials of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party government.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the comments while meeting with local reporters Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yu-hao, the former Tuntex Group tycoon who is on Taiwan's 10
most wanted list, said over the past few weeks through local media
that he had offered political donations or cash to President Chen,
the first lady and two high-ranking officials of the ruling
government.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Chen Yu-hao should not make such statements and
allegations through the media and that the allegations should be
handled by the law.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the businessman has said that he made
political donations to the Chen-Lu campaign headquarters during the
2000 presidential election, the vice president said that she did not
know anything about the financial situation of the campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan still lacks a perfect rule of law despite the fact that it
has become a democratic country, Lu said, adding that the island
should further improve its legal system and that Taiwan people should
realize that it's the job of the law rather than the media to decide
whether a person has committed a crime or not.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Chen Yu-hao still has to respect the law and depend
on the law to solve problems.

OVER 80 PERCENT OF WOMEN FEEL UNEQUAL TO MEN IN WORKPLACE: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei. March 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 80 percent of working women said
their pay and chances of promotion at work are not equal with their
male counterparts, while around 65 percent said sexual harassment is
a serious problem in the workplace, a survey showed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Women's Day, a survey on the misery and happiness
of working women was conducted by two online companies -- a job
hunting company, www.9999.com.tw, and a company devoted to women,
www.33beauty.com.tw, and Cosmopolitan magazine between Feb. 16 and
March 2 via e-mails. A total of 5,358 valid responses were collected
with a margin of error of 1.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 80.59 percent of the women who responded
said unequal pay at work is very serious or serious, while 73.23
percent said that unequal promotion is very serious or serious. Only
3.04 percent and 2.35 percent said pay and promotion chances are
equal, respectively.
</P>
<P>
On sexual harassment at work, 64.95 percent of the women said the
situation is very serious or serious. The more alarming statistic is
that 37.78 percent of the women surveyed said that they are
frequently sexually harassed, and of those, 65.41 percent said the
harassment came mostly from their bosses or superiors.
</P>
<P>
The sexual harassment mostly took the form of language abuse,
pornographic e-mails and body contact. Just over 52 percent of the
women said that they took no actions against this behavior.
</P>
<P>
In a score of one to 100 to represent the highest misery index,
Taiwan working women rated their misery index at 67.19 points, with
100 being the highest score. The survey also found that up to 57.73
percent of the working women believe that it is better to marry a
good husband than do well at work.
</P>
<P>
Those conducting the survey concluded that working women in
Taiwan are miserable, and that because of their resigned attitude,
harassment at work has not decreased significantly.
</P>
<P>
They urged the government to pay more attention to the matter so
that working women can work in a more friendly environment.

SINGAPORE UNLIKELY TO APPROVE LONGER MATERNITY LEAVE MANDATORY

<P>
The Singapore government has hinted that
it is not likely to make longer maternity leave mandatory under the
law.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong said
on a TV program to air Saturday that he was not keen on forcing
longer maternity leave on employers because this might become a
reason to hire fewer women.

Lee said it was also not cast in stone that the government will
foot the entire bill for longer maternity leave -- it may just pay
half or three quarters.

<P>
Earlier, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Population had
suggested two ways to extend maternity leave.
</P>

An extra two months mandatory leave with the government picking
up the tab for full pay, or an extra four months, mutually agreed

RESTRICTIONS ON MAINLAND SPOUSES  DO NOT VIOLATE HUMAN RIGHTS: LU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  6  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imposing different restrictions on
immigrants from different countries according to their attitudes
toward Taiwan is not discrimination and does not constitute any
violation of human rights, Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chatting with a group of journalists at an informal gathering in
her office Saturday morning, the outspoken human right activist, who
heads a national human rights panel at the Presidential Office, came
to the defense of the government for its decision that mainland
spouses coming to live in Taiwan must provide a financial
certificate. The measure has since been overturned.
</P>
<P>
Lu said human rights can be divided into different categories,
such as those for groups, individuals, as well as absolute human
rights and relative human rights.
</P>
<P>
The human rights of a group prevail in cases that conflict with
the rights of an individual. Individual human rights should be
subordinate to group human rights, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that mainland China is the only country out of the 192
states in the world that is hostile toward Taiwan and is building up
its military forces with an eye to invading Taiwan, it is only
natural for Taiwan to somewhat restrict people's exchanges with the
mainland for the sake of national security, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
It is not a violation of human rights to discriminate between
immigrants from friendly states and immigrants from bellicose states
and impose different restrictions on them accordingly, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement when asked to comment on measures
subsequently dropped by the Ministry of the Interior that ordered
mainlanders who want to reunite with their Taiwanese spouses in
Taiwan to come up with financial certificates to prove they or their
Taiwanese spouses have deposits of more than NT$5 million
(US$150,716).
</P>
<P>
This restriction, announced on March 2 was rescinded by the
Ministry of the Interior the next day after causing an uproar among
local human rights activists. They chastised the government for
discriminating against mainlanders and infringing on the human rights
of both mainlanders and their Taiwan spouses.

SINAPORE OUTLINES STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE MARITIME HUB STATUS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore,   March   6  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore is embarking on a
three-pronged strategy to enhance its status as the region's premier
shipping hub.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Transport Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said the move was to
upgrade Singapore as an International Maritime Center. To support the
strategy, the Singapore Maritime Foundation was launched on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yeo welcomed the setting up of the Singapore Maritime Foundation
-- a private sector-led body that will act as the representative
voice of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Today, Singapore is the busiest port in the world in terms of
shipping tonnage. But regional competition has been growing of late.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goals, the Maritime and Port Authority of
Singapore has formulated three approaches.
</P>
<P>
The first is to intensify efforts to attract shipowners and
operators to set up their Asian base in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The second, the Maritime and Port Authority is also looking to
make Singapore a one-stop center for maritime ancillary services,
including marine insurance, legal services, ship management and ship
financing.
</P>
<P>
Third, the government will use fiscal and regulatory policies to
enhance the operating environment for the maritime industry.
</P>
<P>
Yeo also promised to continuously review and fine-tune the tax
system and industry incentives.
</P>
<P>
Teo Siong Seng, chairman of the Singapore Maritime Foundation,
said: "We will bring together the various maritime sub-sectors to
participate in international maritime exhibitions, conferences and
events, both locally and overseas under the banner of the Singapore
flag. We will need to do more to put Singapore's maritime expertise
on the world map."
</P>
<P>
Among the concerns the foundation is looking at is the training
and supply of skilled manpower for the maritime industry.

PRESIDENT CHEN HAILS OPENING OF COLLEGE OF HAKKA CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hsinchu,  Taiwan,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said
Sunday that the establishment of a Hakka culture college under
National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) marks yet another step forward
in his administration's efforts to preserve Taiwan's cultural
diversity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony marking the opening of the NCTU's College
of Hakka Culture in Hsinchu County's Chupei township in northern
Taiwan, Chen said his administration has adopted many measures over
the past four years to promote Hakka cultural development.
</P>
<P>
"We have created a Cabinet-level council in charge of Hakka
affairs and a Hakka television station and have sponsored an annual
Hakka culture festival to signify our concern about the well-being of
the Hakka people and the preservation of Hakka culture, " Chen said.
"And now we have overcome many difficulties to open a Hakka culture
college."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the new College of Hakka Culture at NCTU will begin
admitting students this autumn, Chen said the new college will help
revive Hakka cultural legacies.
</P>
<P>
Because of the previous Kuomintang administration's Mandarin
Chinese-dominated cultural development policy during its 55-year
rule, Chen said, Hakka language and culture have almost fallen into
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the establishment of the new NCTU college will help
cultivate a new generation of Hakka scholars and artists to protect
Taiwan's cultural diversity," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The new college is housed in former Taiwan Provincial Government
Chairman Lin Kwang-hua's ancestral home. Lin, a Hakka political
heavyweight, donated his ancestor's home to NCTU to facilitate the
opening of the Hakka culture college.
</P>
<P>
NCTU President Chang Chun-yen said students of the new college
will study courses required for Hakka culture research in the first
two academic years and will be allowed to pursue different
professional disciplines, including architecture, communications
technology, economics, sociology and linguistics, in the third and
fourth years.

RIVAL CAMPS COMPETING TO WIN YOUNGER VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both the "pan-green camp" of President Chen
Shui-bian and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan have pulled out all the stops to try to win the
votes of Taiwan's younger generation.
</P>
<P>
The two camps have been particularly targeting the 1.5 million
young men and women who have turned 20 within the last four years and
will be eligible to vote in a presidential election for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
With only 13 days to go before the March 20 presidential
election, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , the major
force of the "pan-green camp, " is holding campaign activities aimed
at attracting younger voters, while the opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
the main force of the "pan-blue alliance, " is trying to attract
young voters with policy promises.
</P>
<P>
The DPP has in the past pushed for legislation to lower the
minimum voting age to 18, and each year it holds a "young leaders
camp" in an effort to try to consolidate its support among young
people. It has also sponsored other activities for young people, such
as radio talk shows aimed at younger listeners, said Chiu Tai-san, a
DPP legislator who is one of the major figures behind the party's
efforts to attract young voters.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chun-you, deputy director of the DPP Department of Youth
Affairs, said Sunday that all recent public opinion polls have shown
that the DPP is leading in support as well as approval ratings among
young voters of the country.
</P>
<P>
Lin, meanwhile, lashed out at KMT Chairman Lien Chan for his
recent platform of pushing for military service reform, noting that
President Chen Shui-bian has advocated a step-by-step reform of
military service over the past four years. Lin said Lien's latest
policy stance on the issue contains no new ideas and "is just a
scheme to try to win votes."
</P>
<P>
Lien Chan on Saturday reiterated his military service reform plan
in which he promised to reduce the length of compulsory military
service to three months and create a fully professional military made
up of 120,000 troops, 80,000 officers and non-commissioned officers,
and 50,000 graduates of military schools.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yi-shih, a KMT legislator and director of the KMT Department
of Youth Affairs, claimed that the DPP's support and approval ratings
among Taiwan's young voters have been dropping fast as the general
public has become disillusioned with the current administration over
the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Lin said despite the DPP's "deep plow" among young voters, the
"pan-blue alliance" has been gaining increasing support among this
group of voters.
</P>
<P>
Citing a recent KMT survey, Lin said that the "pan-blue alliance"
presidential ticket's support rating among people aged between 25 and
40 has surpassed that for the "pan-green camp" presidential ticket,
and that its support rating only trails the "pan-green camp's" by
about 5 percentage points among voters aged between 20 and 25.

In this round of debate, Yeh Yao-peng, a former Control Yuan
member who used to be a founding member of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) represented the "nay" side, while Legislator
Lo Chih-ming of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
represented the affirmative side. The TSU is the DPP's ally in the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the hour-long debate, Yeh claimed that the upcoming
referendum was illegal and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
"The referendum to be held alongside the presidential election is
just President Chen Shui-bian's campaign ploy to boost his
re-election bid," Yeh said in his eight-minute opening remarks.
</P>
<P>
Under the Referendum Act, Yeh said, the president can hold a
referendum only when the nation's sovereign status is threatened.
Claiming that mainland China is not strong enough to attack Taiwan,
Yeh said, Chen has violated the Constitution and the Referendum Act in
calling the upcoming referendum.
</P>
<P>
"Even if mainland China can attack Taiwan, it dare not do so
because it is afraid of U.S. interference and flight of
foreign capital from the mainland," Yeh claimed. "Therefore, I urge
our voters to boycott this unconstitutional and illegal referendum.
Don't cast ballots in the referendum."
</P>
<P>
As to whether Taiwan should buy more anti-missile batteries, Yeh
said it's a complicated issue requiring enormous professional
expertise to answer. Voters should not be asked to make a judgment
on this kind of professional issue.
</P>
<P>
Yeh further said Taiwan's security is an integral part of world
security. "Taiwan should join forces with other peace-loving
countries to work for world peace and Taiwan's leader should not
provoke confrontation simply for electoral campaign purposes."
</P>
<P>
For his part, Legislator Lo defended President Chen's decision
to call a referendum alongside the presidential poll to save
voting cost.
</P>
<P>
Lo claimed that Yeh's opposition to the upcoming referendum
was mainly a tactic to help the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
presidential candidate -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan -- to
embarrass the DPP administration and undermine President Chen's
re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
"If the opposition camp really thinks the referendum is
unconstitutional and illegal, why it would not asked the Council
of Grand Justices to interpret," Lo said, adding that the
constitutionality and legality of the upcoming referendum is
actually beyond question and undisputable.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that Beijing has deployed nearly 500
missiles against Taiwan, Lo said, President Chen is
eligible to call a referendum to protect Taiwan's present status
quo from being changed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Lo said, referendum debate can help enhance local
people's "psychological defense" against mainland China's threat.
</P>
<P>
He further said the TSU which has 12 seats in the Legislature
supports procurement of advanced weaponry systems to beef up
Taiwan's defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
In the sixth-round referendum debate, DPP Legislator Chiu
Tai-shan and Ting Ting-yu, a National Taiwan University sociology
professor, focused their debate on the second referendum question
-- whether Taiwan should negotiate with Beijing for the establishment
of a viable mechanism for peaceful interaction.
</P>
<P>
Chiu said this referendum can help forge a national consensus and
thus give the government a mandate to negotiate with mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
He urged local voters to cast a "yes" vote in this referendum to
boost Taiwan's clout in negotiating with mainland China on the
principle of parity and reciprocity to ensure permanent peace in the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"Solidarity is strength. We should show Beijing and the world
society through this referendum that the people of Taiwan are
united," Chiu said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ting questioned the wisdom of holding the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
"Why should we hold political negotiations with Beijing at this
moment? It is dangerous to negotiate political issues with the
Chinese Communist Party. Taiwan's best strategy is to focus on
economic exchanges with mainland China for the moment. We can
use the vast mainland market to sustain our economic
development. The longer the better. We should separate political and
economic issues in dealing with mainland China," Ting said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Ting went on, mainland China will not touch on the
Taiwan issue in the coming 20 to 30 years so long as Taiwan does not
pursue de jure independence. "And the best way to love Taiwan is
to win the U.S. support and trust," he added.

RIVAL CAMPS PLAN MASSIVE CAMPAIGN RALLIES FOR MARCH 13
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With only 13 days to go before the March 20
presidential election, the two rival camps are planning elaborate
campaign rallies this coming Saturday on the last weekend before the
vote to drum up support for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
While the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) plans to mobilize at least 2.5
million people to take to the streets March 13 in a show of support
for its ticket, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is also
planning a massive parade in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
on the same day to rally support for President Chen Shui-bian's
re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lee Yung-ping told a news conference that the
"pan-blue alliance" will organize street marches in Taiwan's three
largest metropolises in the northern, central and southern parts of
the island -- Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung, respectively -- on
March 13 to whip up support for its ticket of KMT Chairman Lien Chan
and PFP Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
"We'll express our dissatisfaction with the DPP administration's
poor performance over the past four years and our desire for a second
transition of power in the upcoming presidential poll, " Lee said,
adding that the large parades in various parts of the island will
carry the theme of "Change the President, Save Taiwan and Down with
Chen Shui-bian."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lee said, the upcoming campaign rallies will also
highlight the "pan-blue alliance's" goal of "striving for
economic prosperity and peace."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said
the March 13 rallies were originally designated as "anti-corruption"
events against "black gold politics."
</P>
<P>
"But we have changed our plan with a view to broadening the scope
of our appeal, " Hung said, adding that anti-corruption is still one
of the alliance's major concerns.
</P>
<P>
Hung said the "pan-blue alliance's" grass-roots supporters have
pushed the Lien-Soong campaign headquarters to organize massive-scale
rallies to consolidate voter support after the "pan-green camp" of
the DPP and other pro-independence groups successfully organized a
"hand-in-hand" rally on Feb. 28 when more than 2 million people held
hands together to form a 500-km human chain that stretched the length
of Taiwan in a show of support for Chen's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
"Our grass-roots supporters are worried that the 'hand-in-hand'
rally might mislead pundits and ordinary citizens into believing that
the 'pan-green camp' really outweighs our alliance in terms of
support rate, "Hung said. "I'm convinced that we'll be able to rally
an even larger number of supporters for the March 13 street marches."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the "pan-blue alliance's" plan, DPP Legislator Chen
Ching-chun said the opposition camp might be wise to drop its
original designation for its March 13 street rallies.
</P>
<P>
"The results of many public opinion polls have consistently shown
that more than 45 percent still consider the 'pan-blue alliance' as
the epitome of corrupt 'black gold' politics, " Chen Ching-chun
claimed. "We feel regret that the 'pan-blue alliance' still resists
reforms, including hindering the much-anticipated down-sizing of the
Legislative Yuan."
</P>
<P>
Chen Ching-chun further said if the "pan-blue alliance" truly
supports reform, the KMT should return its ill-gotten huge party
assets to the people as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that reform and anti-"black gold politics" have been
the gist of President Chen's campaign platform, Chen Ching-chun said
the DPP has planned a large parade in Kaohsiung for this coming
Saturday to reaffirm the party's commitment to establishing
clean politics and to rally support for the president's re-election
bid.

PRESIDENT URGES SUPPORTERS TO NOT LET DOWN THEIR GUARD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taoyuan County,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged his
supporters Sunday to not let down their guard in the presidential
race despite his lead over opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
in recent public opinion surveys conducted after the Feb. 28
"hand-in-hand" human chain event.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is seeking re-election, made the appeal while speaking
at a series of campaign rallies held in the northern county of
Taoyuan.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he is fairly optimistic about winning the March 20
election, Chen said that following the successful mobilization of
more than one million people to form a colossal human chain across
the island, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's ticket enjoyed
a clear lead over the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Lien and James
Soong, chairman of the People First Party, in two polls.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the DPP Feb. 29 and March 1,
the support rate for Chen and Vice President Annette Lu was 39.5
percent, while that for Lien and Soong was 36.2 percent. Another
survey conducted by a local public opinion survey company also showed
that the DPP ticket is in the lead.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said the election outcome will be very close, with
the margin of victory being only between 30,000 and 50,000 votes.
"I'm hopeful that all of our supporters will not let down their guard
and will persist until we win the election," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chen also hailed Lu as an able woman and voiced
the hope that the first female vice president of Taiwan will be
re-elected March 20 to set another milestone in the nation's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Women's Day, which falls on March 8, the president
gave his salute to all the women of Taiwan and claimed that the DPP
was the first party in Taiwan to nominate women candidates to compete
in mayoral and county magistrate elections.
</P>
<P>
As for the "pan-blue alliance's" plan to mobilize one million
supporters to participate in a mass "anti-corruption" rally slated
for March 13 to reduce the impact of the Feb. 28 "hand-in-hand"
event, Chen said that the planned rally will backfire as the former
Kuomintang government was closely linked to the so-called "black
gold" politics.
</P>
<P>
Acording to Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also
chairman of the "pan-blue alliance" national campaign headquarters,
the opposition group will organize a mass rally of one million people
March 13 in northern, central and southern Taiwan to voice their
strong desire for clean politics and love for Taiwan.

CAMPAIGN SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR AS ELECTION DAY APPROACHES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With less than two weeks to go before the
presidential election, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
is trying to extend its supporters' enthusiasm for the "protect
Taiwan" campaign to election day, while the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" is seeking to consolidate its support among its core
supporters.
</P>
<P>
After the successful mobilization of more than one million people
to form a mammoth human chain across Taiwan to mark 2-28 Peace
Memorial Day, the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally -- the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- is hoping its presidential
candidate, President Chen Shui-bian, can ride the success of the
"hand-in-hand" activity and win the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, the DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan,
said the Feb. 28 rally aroused the public's patriotism and raised
their awareness about Taiwan's separate identity. He voiced the hope
that the passion of DPP supporters will extend to the March 20
presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
In the coming two weeks, Tsai said, the DPP will continue to
organize a series of large-scale campaign rallies around the island
in a bid to maintain the people's zeal to defend the country and
translate this strong feeling into support for Chen in the election.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that the Executive Yuan, for its part, should seek to
boost its administrative performance so that people may recognize all
the efforts made by the ruling party over the past four years, and
forge prospects of reform to win support from the majority of voters.
</P>
<P>
Tsai further said that the planned first-ever nationwide
referendum and the "Taiwan 100" campaign are also DPP's major appeals
for people's support for Chen's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
The "Taiwan 100" campaign is aimed at urging voters to choose the
No. 1 candidate -- Chen Shui-bian -- in the election and to vote
"yes" for both referendum questions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to electing a president and vice president, voters
will also cast two additional ballots for the two questions put forth
in the referendum to be held alongside the presidential poll. The
questions are whether Taiwan should increase its anti-missile
defenses if mainland China refuses to remove its deployed missiles
aimed at Taiwan, and whether the government should negotiate with
Beijing for the establishment of an interaction mechanism for peace
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the series of DPP-staged strong campaign
offensives, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also
chairman of the "pan-blue alliance" national campaign headquarters,
said that the opposition group will organize a mass rally of one
million people March 13 to voice their strong desire for clean
politics and love for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the large-scale rally to be held in northern, central and
southern Taiwan will help lift the morale of the "pan-blue alliance"
after the DPP succeeded in organizing the "hand-in-hand" human chain
activity on Feb. 28 to say "no" to Beijing's missile threat against
the island," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The legislative head added that the "pan-blue alliance" will
boost its campaign strategy by "emphasizing reforms, bringing
forward concrete economic development policies and highlighting
the presidential candidate's personality and characteristics" in the
coming two weeks.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Legislator Huang Yi-chiao, who is also the PFP
spokesman, said the opposition alliance will also try to emphasize
that a "change" in Taiwan's leadership "will bring a brighter future
for Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The presidential race has been too close to call for weeks, but
the 2-28 human chain rally seemed to give President Chen a boost,
with a DPP poll conducted Feb. 29 and March 1 showing his support
rate at 39.5 percent, ahead of his challenger KMT Chairman Lien
Chan's 36.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chen pulled ahead by nearly 20 percentage points in southern
Taiwan, traditionally the DPP's stronghold. The ruling
ticket also led by four percentage points in central Taiwan and by up
to seven percentage points among younger voters, according to the
DPP poll.

BOTH CAMPS TARGET WORKERS AS ELECTION DAY APPROACHES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the March 20 presidential election
just around the corner, the two rival camps' efforts to broaden their
respective support bases, particularly among laborers, have
intensified.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of both President Chen Shui-bian's "pan-green camp"
and those of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's
"pan-blue alliance" have claimed that they have the support of labor.
</P>
<P>
While the "pan-blue alliance" has claimed that 70 percent of the
country's workers will vote for Lien and his running mate, People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, the "pan-green camp" has said
it has the support of at least 60 percent of the working vote.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which was an
influential force behind Taiwan's labor, social and aboriginal
activist campaigns when it was the major opposition party, has
recently regained its confidence in consolidating its support among
people from all walks of life after it sponsored the "one million
people hand-in-hand" human chain campaign on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
Lai Ching-teh, director of the DPP's Department of Labor Affairs,
said that although some labor activist groups have called for their
members to boycott the March 20 election to show their displeasure
with both candidates, the DPP is confident it will win some 60
percent of the workers' votes.
</P>
<P>
Lai said KMT Chairman Lien Chan's advocacy of a national pension
plan in which he promises a high premium deposit rate of 18 percent
for retired laborers is doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Lien-Soong ticket's insistence on the
pro-unification "92 consensus" would also be catastrophic for the
country's workers if the pair is elected, whereupon pro-China
policies would be carried out, including the introduction of mainland
Chinese laborers into Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Still, Lin Hui-kuan, president of the Chinese Federation of
Labor, who is also an opposition PFP legislator, said that the DPP's
support rating among workers has continued to decline as a result of
the DPP administration's approval of a change to regulations to allow
foreign laborers to extend their work period in Taiwan for up to
three years. The previous maximum extension was two years.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the "pan-blue alliance" ticket's support rate
in southern Taiwan is about 55 percent, ahead of the "pan-green
camp's" 45 percent, and its support rate in northern Taiwan is around
70 percent, compared to the "pan-green camp's" 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cheng Chun-chi, former director of Taipei City's Labor
Affairs Bureau and current head of the blue-collar activists group
Action Committee for Labor Legislation, said his group's advocacy of
having one million null ballots cast in the March 20 referendum
initiated by President Chen remains on target.
</P>
<P>
Chien Hsi-chieh, a former DPP legislator and now one of the
decision makers of the "pan-purple alliance" made up mainly of
disadvantaged and social welfare groups, said supporters of the
alliance will boycott the March 20 presidential election altogether
to convey the message that both candidates are "bad apples" that are
not qualified to win any votes from the people.

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES NECK-AND-NECK AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two presidential candidates --
President Chen Shui-bian and opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan, are running neck-and-neck in terms of popularity among Taiwan's
university students, according to the results of a survey released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion poll conducted by Shih Hsin University in Taipei,
27.3 percent of 801 students who have the right to vote and were
interviewed in the survey favor the presidential ticket of Chen and
his running mate, Annette Lu, while 27.1 percent support Lien and his
running mate, James Soong. Some 30 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
They were also evenly divided on the first of two questions in
the proposed referendum -- whether the country should strengthen its
missile defense capability -- with 31.1 percent saying "yes, " as
advocated by Chen and Lu, against 29.2 percent who said they will
follow the suit of Lien and Soong in boycotting the referendum. Nine
percent said they will vote "no" and 24.3 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
The second question in the referendum -- whether the country
should negotiate for peace with the mainland -- is less
controversial, with 40.2 percent saying "yes, " 27.8 percent saying
they will boycott the vote, 3.2 percent saying they will vote "no"
and 24.1 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
Students with right to vote for the first time accounted for
about 40 percent of the students interviewed and 64.9 percent said
they will vote in the March 20 presidential election, which is 14.6
percent higher than that of those who are not first-time voters.
</P>
<P>
Of all the students with the right to vote, about 60 percent said
they will vote in the election, against 20 percent who said they
won't.
</P>
<P>
Among the total of 1,152 students interviewed, however, 33.4
percent said they believe Lien and Soong will win the election
against 16.6 percent for the Chen-Lu ticket and 38.9 percent who said
the outcome is "unpredictable."
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out between Feb. 27 and March 2 through
face-to-face interviews with students from 22 universities and
colleges in northern Taiwan.

ECONOMIC EXPANSION INDEX TO REACH 58.13 PERCENT IN FIRST QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fueled by a rebounding global economy as
well as continued growth of domestic exports and manufacturing sector
production, the economic expansion index in the first quarter of this
year is expected to reach 58.13 percent, up 4.4 percent from the
fourth quarter of 2003, according to a report released Monday by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).
</P>
<P>
An MOEA official said that the ministry issued the report after
analyzing the results of a survey conducted among 9,700 manufacturers
Feb. 10-25 to gain a better understanding of their viewpoints on the
domestic economic climate and trends. A total of 8,264 responses were
received, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector's business growth index topped the list
at 65.4 percent, the highest level since 2000, followed by the
wholesale and retail sectors at 55.77 percent and the leasing and
technical service sectors at 55.25 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being optimistic about Taiwan's economic recovery,
as many as 73.2 percent of those polled said they had invested in
fixed assets last year. In terms of investment value, the information
and electronic sectors topped the list at NT$269.2 billion (US$8.08
billion), accounting for 78 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 885 manufacturers said that they are planning to
invest in fixed assets this year, up by 50 from the year-earlier
level, the report pointed out. The total investment value is
estimated at NT$300.8 billion, representing an annual growth of
NT$101.4 billion.

KMT CHIEF ADVOCATES CROSS-STRAIT STATUS QUO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition presidential candidate Lien Chan
said in a recent interview with Time magazine that his camp believes
in maintaining the status quo in regard to relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Lien, who is the sole challenger of President Chen Shui-bian in
Taiwan's March 20 presidential election, noted that the Republic of
China has been in existence for 93 years and said that his "pan-blue
alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang and its ally the People First
Party, opposes Taiwan independence and does not see unification with
mainland China likely in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that if the mainland insists on the resumption of
cross-strait talks under the "one China" principle, then it will be
difficult for such talks to resume.
</P>
<P>
This is because for the "pan-blue alliance, " "one China" means
the Republic of China, Lien said, a concept that Beijing refuses to
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if elected March 20, he will embark on a "peace
journey" to the mainland before his May 20 inauguration and will
propose to Beijing that it gradually dismantle the missiles it has
deployed against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said he has no way of knowing if Beijing would welcome such a
visit, or its attitude toward resuming cross-strait talks.
</P>
<P>
But he said Beijing should know that it will be different dealing
with his alliance than with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
because while his alliance will insist on the sovereignty of the ROC,
it will not promote Taiwan independence.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if confrontation between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait continues, it will become more and more difficult for
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The disputes over sovereignty will not be resolved in the
foreseeable future, but there are many issues concerning the common
interests of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Lien observed,
adding that cross-strait relations are a self-imposed blockage. By
this, he meant that cross-strait political relations are stalled, but
in all other ways, exchanges are brisk.
</P>
<P>
With the strengthening of Taiwan's democracy, the consciousness
of Taiwanese people has been raised, Lien said, adding that it is
natural and healthy to be democratic and Taiwanized, although one
should not consider narrow-minded Taiwanization as tantamount to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
He added that every Taiwan person will fight for Taiwan's
democracy and freedom regardless of his background or political
affiliation.

<P>
Singapore Airlines (SIA) pilot Ryan Goh,
reacting to the Home Affairs Ministry's notice that his entry
and re-entry permits will be revoked, said he would appeal.
</P>
<P>
The notice means Goh will lose his permanent resident status in
Singapore. He has seven days to appeal, and Thursday is the deadline
to submit a written appeal.

<P>
The 43-year-old pilot had been declared an "undesirable

<P>
Education Minister Huang Jong-tsun said
Monday that the ministry has yet to allow accreditation in Taiwan of
diplomas issued by mainland Chinese schools.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks when he was reporting on the
transformation and evolution of technical and vocational education to
the Education Committee at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Huang mentioned in the report that the ministry will strengthen
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges and cooperation and revise related
regulations in view of the recognition of credits acquired in
mainland schools, as well as encourage all levels of schools to
cooperate with Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland to
establish technical and vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Diane Lee noted that the Ministry of Education used to
say that the accreditation of mainland diplomas hinges on the policy
and stance of the Mainland Affairs Council, and she asked Huang if
his report means that the ministry's policy has changed toward
opening to accreditation.
</P>
<P>
Huang stressed that the existing policy still stands and added
that his report only reflects the hopes and suggestions of technical
and vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that Taiwan will talk with the mainland under
the framework of the World Trade Organization about mainland schools
recruiting students in Taiwan, as well as the accreditation of
mainland diplomas.

OPPOSITION CAMP PRESENTS DRAFT BILL ON VOLUNTARY MILITARY SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucuses of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) jointly presented a
draft bill on voluntary military service Monday for deliberation in
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative whip Liao Feng-teh and PFP legislative whip Hsieh
Chang-chieh said at a joint news conference that the draft statute
contains elaborate provisions for implementing an enlistment-based
military service system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a televised presidential campaign forum sponsored by
the Central Election Commission last weekend, KMT Chairman Lien Chan,
who teams up with PFP Chairman James Soong to challenge President
Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid, said if he wins the March 20
election, his administration will complete military service reform by
2008.
</P>
<P>
"The voluntary military service draft bill is the first
step to realize Lien's campaign promise," Liao said, adding that the
KMT-PFP alliance, better known as the "pan-blue alliance," will
push for inclusion of the bill into the legislature's screening
agenda at Tuesday's Steering Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Liao said, the "pan-blue alliance," which controls a
majority in the legislature, hopes to complete legislation of the
voluntary military service statute before the presidential poll to
betray its presidential candidate's determination to deliver on his
campaign promise.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance"-drafted bill encompasses five chapters
with a total of 54 articles, regulating the enlisted targets,
qualifications, enlisted troop rankings, duration of service, salary
and fringe benefits, scholarship, welfare benefits for their
families, pension and other compensation.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the "pan-blue alliance's" move, Tsai Huang-lang, the
legislative whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
said military service reform is a rather serious issue that should not be
addressed in a hasty, perfunctory manner.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tsai said, the "pan-blue alliance's" proposal is just
a ploy to court young voters.
</P>
<P>
In last Saturday's TV speech on his platform, Lien said if he
wins the presidency, his administration will facilitate the passage
of a bill creating a fully professional military service system
within one year and pass a special budget of NT$60 billion to put the
policy into effect as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to Lien's plan, Taiwan's fully voluntary or
professional military would require 120,000 troops, 80,000 officers
and non-commissioned officers and 50,000 graduates of military
schools to make up a high-quality, defensive force.
</P>
<P>
Lien's plan also requires all young men of draft age participate
in a military training course lasting three months.
</P>
<P>
In the same TV forum, President Chen said a fully voluntary
military is a goal that can be achieved only in a gradual manner,
rather than in what he called an improvised manner as Lien's.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that Lien's plan could lead to "hollowing out"
of Taiwan's national defense base.

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A set of mechanisms worked out by the
Kaohsiung city government to fend off dengue fever officially kicked
off Monday following an announcement by Vice Mayor Lin Yung-chien.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the announcement at a municipal meeting in which it was
decided that from March 11, all city government agencies, schools and
residents must conduct self-control management to clean up their
environment every Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was also announced that Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties will
announce in a coordination conference next week their joining with
Kaohsiung City every Thursday to combat the mosquito-borne disease to
prevent its spread in all three areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, there was only one dengue fever case in
Kaohsiung City during the Jan. 1-March 7 period and this was proven
to be an infection picked up overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung citizen was confirmed to have contracted dengue
fever after developing diarrhea, headache and fever following a trip
to Thailand from Jan. 18 to Feb. 8. The patient made a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
Lin added that after continued tracing and monitoring via
telephone by municipal health workers of citizens who have come back
from countries in Southeast Asia, no further cases have been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
From April 14, the municipal environmental protection personnel
will begin disinfection work in city streets with the onset of hotter
summer weather in an effort to help wipe out the disease.

25,000 OVERSEAS SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT TO RETURN TO CAST BALLOTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 5,000 overseas supporters of President
Chen Shui-bian have returned to Taiwan to canvass support for his
re-election bid, the head of the Federation of A-bian Overseas
Supporters Clubs (FAOSC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at Chen's campaign headquarters in
Taipei, FAOSC chief Wu Li-pei said more than 25,000 supporters are
expected to return to vote for Chen -- nicknamed A-bian -- in the
March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wu said overseas Taiwanese are as concerned about the
presidential election as people in Taiwan. "Chen's overseas
supporters have formed more than 70 associations in five continents
around the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, all those groups have rallied behind Chen mainly
because they believe that he can substantiate Taiwan's transformation
into a full democracy and safeguard Taiwan's independent sovereign
status.
</P>
<P>
In addition to campaigning for Chen, Wu said the returning
overseas supporters are also endeavoring to persuade local voters to
cast ballots in Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum to be held
alongside the election.
</P>
<P>
"It's weird that some local politicians have launched a movement
against the March 20 referendum. If they think the referendum is
unlawful, they should seek a remedy through administrative relief
channels instead of dissuading voters from taking part. They have set
a bad model for democracy," Wu claimed.
</P>
<P>
When Taiwanese expatriates in the United States worked for
Taiwan's democratization in the past, Wu recalled, Americans often
asked whether people in Taiwan truly desired democracy.
</P>
<P>
"I hope local voters will cast ballots in the upcoming referendum
to show the world their love for peace and democracy as well as their
aversion to war and the missile threat from China. The referendum is
the best chance for us to be heard," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked two questions in the upcoming referendum --
whether Taiwan should buy more anti-missile batteries in the face of
mainland China's intensified missile threat and whether Taiwan should
negotiate a viable mechanism with Beijing for peaceful interaction.

PREMIER URGES VOTERS TO GIVE PRESIDENT FOUR MORE YEARS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged the electorate
Monday to give President Chen Shui-bian four more years in office,
assuring them that they will see a "big harvest" if Chen is given
another term.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks when he was interviewed by a local
television station, during which he talked with Professor Lee
Hung-hsi of National Taiwan University.
</P>
<P>
Yu lauded the high ability of the Cabinet, citing as examples the
improvement of the water quality of Kaohsiung City, which has long
plagued city residents, the establishment of the Taichung
Science-based Industrial Park and the dredging of the Keelung River.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the previous Kuomintang (KMT) administrations could
"talk big, but could not act on their words, " Yu accused the KMT of
failing to upgrade industry during its rule, which has resulted in
domestic industries flocking out of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that opposition KMT presidential candidate Lien Chen
floated the idea of turning the country into an Asia-Pacific
operations center when he was serving as premier, but added that he
failed to deliver on the project.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the KMT, Yu went on, the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) "has kept its word." After nearly four years in office,
the DPP has successfully upgraded industry, to which a recent influx
of foreign capital attests, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If the DPP can have four more years, the economy will have even
better prospects," according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
He compared ruling a nation to planting a field, saying that the
first four years must be spent cutting weeds and applying fertilizer.
Now, he said, the rice is growing and pretty soon, it will be time to
harvest.
</P>
<P>
"If President Chen wins re-election, the next four years will see
a big harvest," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition is adopting a strategy of slinging
mud at the DPP and he asked voters to choose Chen, who he described
as having proved his planning and his ability to carry out his plans
to the public.
</P>
<P>
The premier also reaffirmed the importance of legislative
reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reforms can be divided into two parts -- the
halving of the 225-seat legislature and the idea of a single seat for
a single constituency.
</P>
<P>
He said that the single seat, single constituency reform would
also contribute to changing the quality of legislators'
interpellation sessions, noting that the current practice of having
more than one seat for each constituency has led to the election of
some radical legislators.

SINGAPORE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AMONG MOST EFFICIENT IN WORLD: SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore's health care system is among
the most efficient in the world, according to the results of a survey
of developed countries by Singapore's Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry published the survey results Saturday to show
that the co-payment system in Singapore has led to more efficient
choices in terms of health care services.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's co-payment system, where patients bear at least 20
percent of the bill, was defended by the Health Ministry as a
necessary measure to keep the health care system efficient.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Health Balaji Sadasivan said that "there
must be co-payment for health care so that the demand for health care
services is brought under control. However, the co-payment amount
must be reasonable so that people can afford."
</P>
<P>
Among all the countries surveyed, patients in Singapore have the
shortest average hospital stay at 4.8 days, or almost half of
Holland's average of nine days.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients being admitted to hospitals has also been
falling steadily in Singapore since 1991. And in 2000, the number of
people being admitted into Singapore hospitals was among the lowest
among developed countries.

Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
announced Monday that the Legislative Yuan will recess from March 12

</P>
<P>
Wang made the announcement after an initial agreement reached

Based upon the agreement, an additional floor meeting will be

<P>
Wang added that the legislature will give top priority to
screening a proposal for halving the number of legislative seats and
other motions concerning constitutional amendments after the

</P>
<P>
The legislative head also said that the caucus of the Independent
Legislators Alliance was reluctant to sign the agreement reached
among the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, the Kuomintang, the
People First Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union, so the
negotiation procedure has yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
The ruling and opposition parties' caucuses will continue their
negotiations at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, Wang added.

OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE VOWS TO IMPROVE ECONOMY IF ELECTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition presidential candidate Lien Chan
vowed Monday that if elected, he will adopt a broad-vision approach
toward developing the nation's economy to ensure rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Lien claimed that the recent stock market recovery in Taiwan was
due mainly to the international economic recovery and the influx of
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that private investment and consumption are
still sluggish, although the overall economic recovery will depend on
the increase of private spending and investment. If these issues can
be improved, then Taiwan's economy will be on the path to recovery,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his "4-5-6" goal for the nation, meaning to cut the
unemployment rate to under 4 percent, raise the economic growth rate
to 5 percent, and balance the budget in six years.
</P>
<P>
On cross-strait trade, Lien reaffirmed that he will achieve
direct cross-strait cargo transport within one year, direct air
transport within two years, and allow one million visitors from
mainland China each year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that direct cross-strait trade, postal and transport
links will not affect Taiwan's labor or agriculture.

NOBEL LAUREATE HECKMAN INVITED AS ECONOMIC ADVISER TO LIEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Presidential candidate Lien Chan of the
"pan-blue alliance" announced Monday that Nobel Prize winner James
Heckman will be an economic adviser to the new government after May
20 if the "pan-blue alliance" wins the March 20 election.
</P>
<P>
Heckman is the second Nobel laureate to be on the advisers list
with three others to be offered possible future positions.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the National Policy Research Foundation, a
Kuomintang (KMT) -run think tank, invited Nobel Prize-winner Laurence
R. Klein last week to be an economic adviser, and that Heckman has
expressed an interest in helping as well shows that the "pan-blue
alliance" is determined to boost the economy, Lien said.
</P>
<P>
Heckman spoke Monday on the revolution that has taken place in
the global labor market and Taiwan's future development. Also
attending the meeting were Vice President of the Legislative Yuan P.
K. Chiang, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Chao Yao-tung and other
scholars.
</P>
<P>
According to Heckman, an open economic system in the long term
has more potential, whereas a closed one is susceptible to adverse
impacts. New incentives will step up productivity while isolated
policies will downgrade productivity. He went on to say that
restrictive measures will lower the migration of laborers. Political
leaders should be aware of the importance of changing economic
trends.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Taiwan's strength is stimulating mainland
China's economic revolution, openness and growth. However, protective
policies may be needed in Taiwan during this transition period, but
decent policies need to be carried out to avoid unfairness to future
generations and to avoid slowing down economic advancement.
</P>
<P>
Lien said after the meeting that the negative impact on the
self-confined attitude toward the Taiwan-mainland China relationship
needs to be further evaluated; he also noted that Taiwan has
succeeded before in keeping the unemployment rate below 3 percent,
but it has increased dramatically in the last four years and poses a
serious threat to society.
</P>
<P>
Heckman was the 2000 Nobel Prize winner in economics, and
specializes in econometrics and microeconomics, with extended
experimental studies in labor supply, salary allocation and auxiliary
plans in the labor market.

MOFA TO STRENGTHEN CONTACTS WITH U.S. OVER HONG KONG ISSUE: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will
strengthen contacts with the United States over Hong Kong's
democratic development issues, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
Michael Ying-mao Kau said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kau said, the foreign ministry will give moral support
to Hong Kong's pursuit of full democracy.
</P>
<P>
Kau made the remarks while fielding questions at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Legislator Parris Chang of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Hong Kong's prominent
dissident lawmaker Martin Lee testified before a U.S. Senate hearing
last Friday on the former British colony's demand for full democracy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the hearing reflected increasing U.S. concern about
Hong Kong's democratic development, Chang suggested that the foreign
ministry issue a statement in support of Hong Kong's democratization.
</P>
<P>
In response, Kau said the foreign ministry seldom deals with
politically sensitive issues. Nevertheless, he said, the foreign
ministry will reinforce contact with U.S. authorities over issues
regarding Hong Kong's democratization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kau said, the foreign ministry-operated Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy will serve as a platform for promoting
democratic diplomacy with other parts of the world, including Hong
Kong and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate realization of this goal, Kau said the foundation
has launched a quarterly as a forum for academic exchanges among
Chinese societies around the world.
</P>
<P>
"The inaugural issue, published early this month, contains
articles written by eight scholars at home and abroad. The articles
address issues regarding Taiwan's democratic experiences as well as
its plight and challenges," said Kau, who concurrently serves as the
foundation's chief executive. "We'll invite scholars and experts in
mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore to contribute papers or
articles to our new publication," Kau said.

PRESIDENTIAL RACE IN STATISTICAL DEAD HEAT: THINKTANK-SPONSORED POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The race in Taiwan between the two
candidates for president is a statistical dead heat with less than
two weeks before the March 20 election, a poll released Monday shows.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by Focus Survey Research under the
consignment of Taiwan Thinktank. Taiwan Thinktank is an organization
friendly to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, President Chen Shui-bian's support rate
was 40.4 percent. Opposition Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan's support
stood at 39.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher at Academia Sinica's
Institute of Social Sciences, said although the support rate for Chen
and his running mate, Vice President Annette Lu, has reached a record
high -- surpassing the 40 percent mark for the first time -- the
ticket's lead has also narrowed, down 0.7 percent from last week.
</P>
<P>
With the campaign shifting into high gear as the election
approaches, both camps of Chen and Lien, commonly known as the
"pan-green" camp and the "pan-blue alliance, " respectively, have
pulled out all the stops to try to win the support of different
groups, particularly undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 20.10 percent of those surveyed would not
make their affiliations known or remain undecided, Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
As a majority of the undecided are young men and women, young
people will be the key to deciding which candidate will win, Hsu
said.
</P>
<P>
Both camps have been focusing their campaigns on the 1.5 million
young men and women who have turned 20 within the last four years and
are eligible to vote in the upcoming presidential election for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
While the 2-28 human chain rally gave an evident boost to
President Chen re-election bid, Lien has tried to win the hearts and
souls of young men by advocating an all-recruit military and only
three months of compulsory military service.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey, conducted over the weekend, has a margin of
error of 2.92 percent.

MATSU URGES UNI AIRWAYS TO OPEN ROUTES TO CENTRAL, SOUTHERN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matsu authorities have urged the sole
carrier flying between the outlying island and Taiwan proper to open
routes to destinations in central and southern Taiwan as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The authorities made recently an official request to Taipei-based
UNI Airways Corp. -- the sole carrier approved by the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) to operate routes between Matsu and
Taiwan-- to open the Matsu-Taichung and Matsu-Kaohsuing routes by
April 1.
</P>
<P>
UNI Airways Chairman Cheng Kuang-yung made a promise during a
visit in November to Matsu that the two routes would be opened in
mid-February, but so far nothing has been done.
</P>
<P>
According to Matsu authorities, the postponement of the two
routes has caused discontent and misunderstanding of the Matsu people
and many mainland-based Taiwan businessmen who have long hoped for the
opening, especially after the direct trade and transport service --
the so-called "mini three links" -- were set up in Jan. 2001.
</P>
<P>
The CAA apparently told Legislator Chao Yuan-Jhang that two
routes would open on April 1, but business sources pointed out that
UNI Airways has yet to agree to the prices set by the CAA.

WOMEN ACCOUNT FOR 12 PERCENT  OF SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women account for about 12 percent of all
senior-level decision-making officials at the Executive Yuan and its
subordinate agencies, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Liu Shih-fang
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liu said, 32 percent of intermediate-level
decision-making officials at all central government agencies are
women.
</P>
<P>
"These two figures indicate that Taiwan has made progress in
admitting women to join its policy-making process, " Liu said, adding
that there is still ample room for Taiwan to promote more female
civil servants to management or leadership posts.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at the 2004 Golden Carnation Awards
presentation ceremony in celebration of Women's Day, which is March
8.
</P>
<P>
Under Taiwan's administrative system, civil servants are
classified into senior (grades 10-14) , intermediate (grades 6-9) or
junior (grades 1-5) levels. The 14 levels of administration reflect
an employee's abilities, experience and seniority.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Yuan or Cabinet set up the Golden Carnation Awards
in 2003 to encourage heads of administrative agencies to promote more
women civil servants to take part in the policy-making process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Liu said President Chen Shui-bian has
attached great importance to gender equality in government service
and has directed the Central Personnel Administration (CPA) to hammer
out elaborate measures to substantiate that goal.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the Golden Carnation Awards is part of the
government's efforts to promote gender equality in civil service, "
Liu said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 government agencies, including the CPA, the
Department of Health (DOH) and the National Youth Commission (NYC) ,
received the awards for having promoted many women bureaucrats to
senior- or intermediate-level management posts.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of the Interior, the Kaohsiung City
Government, the Hualien County Government's Land Administration
Office and the government-owned Taipei Veterans General Hospital were
presented special awards for having adopted special measures to
improve facilities and services for their women employees.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the results of a U.N. survey, Su Chien-ling, a
commissioner of the Cabinet's Women's Rights Promotion Commission,
said Taiwan ranks among the frontrunners in Asia in terms of gender
equality in political participation, but still lags many advanced
countries in this regard. The top five in the world rating are all
Scandinavian countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
Many women political appointees in President Chen's
administration, including Chairwoman Chang Fu-mei of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission, Taiwan Provincial Consultative Council
Speaker Yu Ling-ya and Deputy Chairwoman Chang Chin-hua of the
Council of Hakka Affairs, attended the presentation ceremony to show
their support for promotion of more women civil servants to
management posts in government agencies.

Taiwan's permanent mission to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday officially opened its website to

enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In order to help the Taiwan people and relevant organizations
better their understanding regarding the WTO's operations as well as
the mission's activities in the organization, the mission decided to

newly-established website also include the "Doha Round" trade talks
developments and explanations of international trade rules.

ANTI-REFERENDUM ELECTION SUPERVISORS URGED TO RESIGN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Election administrators and supervisors who
have publicly advocated a boycott of the March 20 referendum should
resign immediately in order to maintain the neutrality of the system
in voting affairs, civic groups said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Senior executives from several prominent civic groups, including
the Judicial Reform Foundation (JRF) and the Taipei Society, made the
call after a group of self-proclaimed members from various levels of
election commissions and supervisory panels ran advertisements in
local newspapers last week urging the electorate not to cast ballots
in the upcoming referendum.
</P>
<P>
Hung Yu-hung, president of the Taipei Society, said at a joint
news conference that the move by the officials has seriously violated
the cardinal principles of neutrality and impartiality in voting
administration and supervision.
</P>
<P>
"If those who are responsible for referendum-related
administrative affairs can publicly advocate a boycott of the
referendum, who will believe in the credibility of the voting
mechanism?" Hung asked.
</P>
<P>
Individual members of the central, city and county election
commissions and election supervisory panels definitely can have their
own stances and choices, Hung said. "However, since they have taken
up those posts, they should recognize the importance and sacredness
of their jobs. They should understand that their inability to perform
their duty impartially will sabotage and even destroy our democratic
system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that individual election administrators and supervisors
must serve as guardians and impartial executors of the nation's
electoral system, Hung said they are not entitled to publicly
advocate a boycott of the referendum in their official capacity.
</P>
<P>
Those who have signed their names in the "Say No to Referendum"
advertisements mostly come from the election commissions and
supervisory panels in the opposition Kuomintang-controlled
constituencies, such as Taipei City, Taoyuan County and Taichung
City.
</P>
<P>
A JRF spokesman said their public anti-referendum advocacy has
hurt Taiwan's democratic development and has invited suspicions about
the neutrality and impartiality of those election administrative and
supervisory commissions in handling the upcoming referendum.
</P>
<P>
To protect the image of those bodies, the spokesman said, all the
election administrators and supervisors who have joined the public
anti-referendum drive should resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed regret that the advertisements carry
many misleading allegations, including that the Referendum Act
prohibits the simultaneous holding of a referendum and a presidential
election and that those who administer or cast ballots in what the ad
calls the "illegal and unconstitutional" referendum could be
performing a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
Even if the court rules that the referendum is invalid due to low
voter turnout, the spokesman said, neither voters nor election
administrators will be charged with committing a crime. "This is
common sense. Those election administrators and supervisors should
not use such misleading allegations to intimidate or sway voters."
</P>
<P>
As to the issues of the legality and constitutionality of the
referendum, the spokesman said, opponents should ask the Council of
Grand Justices to clarify the disputes, and should not pass judgment
on their own instead.
</P>
<P>
In the nation's first-ever nationwide referendum to be held
alongside the presidential election on March 20, voters will be asked
two questions -- whether Taiwan should buy more anti-missile
batteries in the face of Beijing's missile threat and whether Taiwan
should negotiate a viable interactive mechanism with Beijing.

MORE STOLEN CARS SEIZED BEFORE HEADING ABROAD
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officers from the Criminal Investigation
Bureau (CIB) raided a container depot in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan
Monday and discovered four Toyota Camry cars inside a container that
was queued for transport to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
According to the container depot operators, the container with
the four Camry cars was registered as a shipment of scrap iron
destined for Cambodia, CIB authorities reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The police found that the company that sponsored the export of
the scrap iron is related to Chou Cheng-hsu, 26, a former worker with
a major Mercedes-Benz car dealer in Taipei, who was arrested Feb. 16
for his alleged involvement in a cross-border car theft ring.
</P>
<P>
Chou and Cheng Fu-hsiang, 42, were arrested in Taoyuan and
Taipei, respectively, on Feb. 16 on charges of fraud and theft. The
pair are believed to be the masterminds behind a cross-border car
theft ring.
</P>
<P>
CIB investigators said they possess evidence showing that Chou
and Cheng have operated a ring that steals new Mercedes-Benz, BMW and
Toyota Camry cars in Taiwan and then ships the stolen vehicles to
southeast Asia for sale.
</P>
<P>
Although the CIB officials thought that the arrest of the pair
would help police stem the cross-border trade in stolen cars,
Monday's discovery of four more stolen Camry cars in the container
bound for Cambodia alerted police that the operations of the
cross-border car theft ring have never ceased.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, CIB officials discovered that members of
the group have created a tight network where division of labor is
key. For example, the individuals responsible for stealing, container
loading, shipping and overseas sales do not know each other,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigators, Chou was also involved in a
series of fraudulent withdrawals from automatic teller machines
islandwide during the Oct. 10 National Day holiday last year.
</P>
<P>
In August 2003, the CIB successfully had 12 stolen new Toyota
Camry cars shipped back to Taiwan from Singapore through the joint
efforts of police, customs and immigration authorities from the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The CIB was tipped off in early July 2003 that a car theft ring
was planning to ship stolen cars to Thailand and Cambodia via
Singapore for sale.
</P>
<P>
After scrutinizing a large stack of container loading documents,
shipping firms' data and customs clearance reports, investigators
uncovered two containers holding eight new Camrys at a container
terminal at Keelung Harbor in late July last year.
</P>
<P>
Through a further analysis of relevant documents, they concluded
that three other containers holding 12 stolen cars had been shipped
to Singapore's Keepel Port.
</P>
<P>
The CIB asked Singaporean customs to assist in intercepting the
containers. CIB and local customs officers then traveled to Singapore
to arrange for shipment of the cars back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to CIB investigations, the 20 new Camrys were stolen in
Tainan, Taichung, Hsinchu and Taoyuan between July 4 and July 9 last
year.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that many Mercedes-Benz were stolen from the
roads of Taiwan and then packed into containers heading to mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
One report recalled the ordeal of a man in Taiwan who had a bit
too much drink one night. Instead of driving home, he parked his
black Mercedes S320 to sleep it off. He later awoke to find himself
inside his car, which was inside a container headed to the mainland's
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Another report told of a wealthy Taiwan businessman going to
Chengdu, the capital city of the southwestern province of Sichuan,
where he spotted a Mercedes that looked exactly like the one that was
stolen from him in Taiwan. He was shocked to find that, in fact, the
car thieves had not even bothered to remove the licence plate -- it
was the man's car.

TAIWAN BECOMES MEMBER OF ADVISORY CENTER ON WTO LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan became a member of the Advisory
Center on WTO Law (ACWL) Monday under the name of "Taiwan, Penghu,
Kinmen, Matsu Separate Customs Territories" when the island's chief
delegate to the World Trade Organization signed an accession protocol
with senior officials from the center.
</P>
<P>
The ACWL membership is significant for Taiwan in terms of dealing
with legal affairs within the WTO, particularly affairs related to
trade dispute settlement issues.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan government and its permanent mission to the WTO
decided to join the ACWL because they consider that reinforcing the
island's capability in dealing with WTO legal affairs is vital for
the island's rights and interests within the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The ACWL, a public international organization independent of the
WTO, was established in 2001 to provide legal advice on WTO law to
developing countries and customs territories, countries with
economies in transition, and least developed countries. Taiwan had to
pay an accession fee of US$30,000 to join the center.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's
permanent representative to the WTO, said Taiwan has achieved its
"win-win" goal since becoming a WTO member in January 2002. He noted
that the island has not only benefited from its WTO membership, but
that it has also made a lot contributions to the organization's
multilateral trade systems.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that in facing the WTO's complicated and many trade
rules as well as the unclear future of the "Doha Round" trade talks,
Taiwan still has plenty of room for improvement within the WTO, Yen
said that this is why the island attaches great importance to its
cooperation with the ACWL.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the ACWL's legal service will play an important
role in the Taiwan government's decision-making process," he added.
</P>
<P>
In response, Frieder Roesler, the center's executive director,
warmly welcomed Taiwan to the ACWL and guaranteed that the center
will provide the island with the best legal services. He also said
that the center is confident about helping Taiwan to obtain the best
results in any future trade dispute settlement proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan lacks experience in terms of the WTO's trade dispute
mechanism as it has never been directly involved in the mechanism.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that after joining the ACWL, Taiwan will obtain
legal advice from the center on WTO laws as well as acquire support
in WTO dispute settlement proceedings and receive assistance in the
training of government officials in WTO law.
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 1, 2004, the ACWL already had 20 developing country
members entitled to the services of the center, and nine developed
country members. The center has also provided legal services to
developing countries in 16 WTO trade dispute settlement cases since
the center was established.

KMT FILES LIBEL SUIT AGAINST TAIWAN PINEAPPLE CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March   9  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
commissioned a lawyer Tuesday to file a libel suit against a vice
chairman of Taiwan Pineapple Corp. after he claimed in an open letter
that the party had accepted NT$100 million (US$3 million) from him as
apolitical donation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
After filing the suit against Huang Tsung-hung with the Taipei
District Court, lawyer Lin Fu-hung said that Huang circulated a
letter among local media charging the KMT with extorting a NT$100
million political donation from him via Liu Tai-ying, former chairman
of the KMT Investment Commission.
</P>
<P>
Huang further said in his letter that he obtained a NT$3 billion
loan from Chang Hwa Commercial Bank through arrangements by former
Pingtung County Magistrate Wu Tze-yuan and alleged that he gave Wu 30
percent of the bank loan as a rebate to be used for KMT Chairman Lien
Chan's 2000 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Describing Wu's accusations as false, the lawyer said that the
alleged NT$100 political donation has been confirmed by the Taipei
Prosecutor's Office during its investigation of an investment project
by Zanadau Development Co. to be a rebate for Liu himself.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rebate was used by Liu for political purposes
and had nothing to do with Lien, who is contesting the re-election of
President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer further said that Huang's application for a bank loan
was rejected because it did not satisfy relevant requirements and
added that the two cases are unrelated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Investigation Bureau issued a news release to say
that it has probed the alleged NT$3 billion bank loan case and that
the political donation case involving Liu had been finalized by the
Taipei Prosecutor's Office.

FOREIGN NOBEL LAUREATE FINED FOR STUMPING FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

<P>
A election monitoring team in Taipei City
decided Tuesday to fine Betty Williams, winner of the 1976 Nobel
Peace Prize, for stumping for President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu in a campaign rally in Taipei City Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The election monitoring panel under the Taipei City Election
Commission decided in a 9-6 vote to give the peace activist from
Northern Ireland a ticket for violating the country's Election and
Recall Law, which forbids foreigners from stumping for any candidate
in the election.
</P>
<P>
The panel made the decision after viewing a video tape of
Sunday's rally, which was organized by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's branch office in Taipei City "to mark Women's Day
and to campaign for Chen and Lu, " according to the application form
filled out by its organizer.
</P>
<P>
In the rally, Williams joined Lu on the platform to read a
declaration of women's rights and wish Lu success in the election,
according to the video tape, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
The panel's decision raise an outcry among the Chen-Lu campaign
team. Campaign Manager Wu Nei-jen decried the decision as
discrimination against Chen and Lu, claiming that opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan -- Chen's rival in the race -- has also
invited several Nobel laureates to visit Taiwan and endorse his
economic policy, which went unpunished by the monitoring panel.

<P>
The Committee for Constitutional Amendment
at the Legislative Yuan will meet for the first time Wednesday and
both the ruling and opposition parties have instructed their party
lawmakers to attend the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, the legislative whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said it is hoped that the
proposal to halve the number of seats in the Legislative Yuan will be
passed before the March 20 presidential election now that both the
ruling and opposition camps have agreed to the idea.
</P>
<P>
Other details of the amendment can be discussed after the
presidential election, said Tsai.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and
the People First Party would prefer not to rush through the
amendments.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liao Feng-teh said the amendment needs to be debated
thoroughly and that legislators should be allowed to air their views
freely.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsieh Chang-chieh, PFP convener at the Legislative
Yuan, said the chaos in the legislature cannot be addressed simply by
cutting the number of legislators and added that other issues, such
as the length of terms for lawmakers and the relationship between the
executive and legislative branches, should also be attended to.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he opposes the ruling party's idea of tying the
constitutional reform to the presidential election.

ACWL IS GOOD ACCESS FOR TAIWAN IN TRADE DISPUTE SETTLEMENTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's membership of the Advisory Center
on WTO Law (ACWL) will provide the country with good access for
settling trade disputes with other countries under the framework of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) , a government official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Bureau of Foreign Trade Deputy Director-General Chu
Wei-cheng, Taiwan's membership of the ACWL will allow the country to
enjoy legal consultation and services provided by the organization
when it encounters trade disputes with other WTO member nations.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan joined the ACWL in its capacity as a developing
country, Chu said, the country will be able to enjoy a certain number
of hours of legal consultancy and services provided by ACWL
specialists in case of trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, ACWL membership will also help Taiwan train
its own officials in international trade, economics and legal
affairs, giving a boost to these areas, in which he said Taiwan has
long been uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan became the ACWL's 35th member state a day earlier after
its permanent representative to the WTO, Yen Ching-chang, signed an
accession protocol with senior ACWL officials in their Geneva
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The ACWL, which was set up in 1999 and formally began operations
in July 2001, is a public world body independent of the WTO. The
purpose of its establishment is to offer legal advice on WTO law to
developing countries, less-developed countries and customs
territories.

PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT  CALL ON VOTERS TO CAST REFERENDUM VOTES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  9 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu called Tuesday for elegible voters to cast
ballots in Taiwan's first nationwide referendum, to be held in
conjunction with the March 20 presidential election, claiming that
this will allow their voices to be heard by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the appeal after hearing a report delivered by Minister
of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien on how to maintain social order and
crack down on vote-buying in the run-up to the election, and another
report on the "peace referendum" delivered by Minister without
Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung during a weekly meeting of the Central
Executive Committee of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
</P>
<P>
Chen, who also doubles DPP chairman, said that with great
confidence in Taiwan and insistence on reforms, the ruling party will
spare no efforts to pursue democratization.
</P>
<P>
With Taiwan's impressive political developments over the decades,
such as the lifting of martial law in 1987, the first direct
presidential election in 1996 and the peaceful transition of power
between different political parties in 2000, the DPP is poised to
carry out the referendum in cooperation with the people, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Referendum is not only a universal value of democracy but also a
basic civil right, " Chen noted. "As the planned referendum is the
first to be held in Taiwan's history, the opposition camp dare not
publicly oppose the referendum, but they have called on their
supporters to refrain from casting referendum ballots as a boycott of
the event," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Central Election Commission decided to hold the
referendum in conjunction with the presidential election according to
the regulations, Chen claimed that the decision does not infringe
upon any laws.
</P>
<P>
"The opposition camp's statement that the referendum is illegal
is obviously nothing but an electoral campaign strategy because they
have been reluctant to come up with a proposal for the Council of
Grand Justices to interpret the issue," according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Describing the referendum as a "democratic banquet" to be shared
by all the people of Taiwan, Chen said that the international
community is closely watching the developments of Taiwan's democratic
development and he voiced the hope that all voters will turn out to
cast a "yes" vote for both referendum questions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to electing a president and vice president, voters
will also cast two additional ballots for the two questions put forth
in the referendum. The questions are whether Taiwan should increase
its anti-missile defenses if mainland China refuses to remove the
missiles it has aimed at Taiwan, and whether the government should
negotiate with Beijing for the establishment of an interaction
mechanism for peace across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lu said in a pre-taped TV interview that the
referendum will be conducive to highlight Taiwan's separate identity
from mainland China and intensify public awareness of defense issues
in the face of the growing missile threat from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Saying that in the face of Beijing's continued deployment of
missiles targeting Taiwan, casting referendum ballots is not only a
right but also an obligation, Lu urged all elegible voters to cast a
"yes" vote for the two questions.

TAIWAN-RUSSIA CHARTER FLIGHTS TO OPERATE ONCE WEEKLY FROM APRIL

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to good business and keen
interest from Taiwan tourists wishing to visit Russia, charter
flights between the two countries will be increased to once weekly
starting from next month, sources in the domestic tourist industry
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
From April 19, Taiwan-Russia charter flights provided by Russia's
Transaero in cooperation with Taiwan-based tourist agencies that
started on Jan. 19 this year will be increased to once per week from
the current irregular service to meet strong demand for sightseeing
travel, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
As sales of the existing irregular charter flights for the period
from the Chinese New Year holiday season in late January to February
have been very good, the two sides reached an agreement recently to
enhance flight services in order to embrace the coming peak summer
season, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, package tour group prices will also be
increased to about NT$59,000 (US$1,772) per person in the coming
months for travel to Russia, a noticeable rise from the present level
of about NT$38,000.

<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that the
economic situation has been well adjusted due to strenuous efforts
over the years, with foreign investors remitting around US$23.2
billion in 2003, equivalent to NT$2.1 billion per day.
</P>
<P>
Yu's comments were prompted by Legislator Lin Wen-lang of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who praised Yu's
performance in the economic and financial fields at a session of the
Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, the economic situation is fairly stable, as
shown by the high marks from international rating institutions.
</P>
<P>
Yu continued that due to the outbreaks of severe acute
respiratory syndrome last year, the growth rate in the second quarter
of 2003 was negative 0.08 percent, with a plummeting stock market.
However, the weighted index -- the market's key barometer --
surged from 4,000 points to around 7,000 points between May 2003 and
March 2004. The performance would have been lackluster if efforts had
not been channelled into boosting the economy, he added.

GROUP TO STAGE PROTEST TO SHOW DISSATISFACTION WITH ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little-known private group calling for
the electorate to abstain from voting in the March 20 presidential
election to show their dissatisfaction with the two candidates in the
race said Tuesday they will stage a march in Taipei March 14 to
promote their cause.
</P>
<P>
Ho Yan-tang, leader of the "Millions of Invalid Votes Union"
called both the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the "pan-blue
alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party "rotten
apples" and urged the public to boycott them in the election.
</P>
<P>
Instead of appealing to voters with their visions for the
country, Ho said, the two candidates have resorted to discrediting
one another, each side going out of its way to smear the other and
leaving no clue as to where they would lead the country if elected.
</P>
<P>
In the March 14 protest, Ho said, 100 members of his union will
lie face down on the ground in front of the Presidential Office with
their hands bound with cords of blue and green -- the colors of the
"pan-blue alliance and the DPP, respectively -- while trying to push
apples with their noses to signify their desire to get rid of what Ho
described as two corrupt political forces.
</P>
<P>
The protesters will then go to the office of the Central Election
Commission and dump 1,000 rotten apples there to reflect their
displeasure with the first-past-the-post presidential election system
and to press their demand for a choice of "none" on the ballots in
addition to the names of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the two election camps of holding the people hostage, Ho
said a vote for either side will not improve democracy in the country
but will only encourage the politicians' greed for power.
</P>
<P>
"Please cast an invalid ballot to protest this," Ho said.

TAIWAN SELLS WELL AT TOKYO INTERNATIONAL FOOD EXHIBITION

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's agricultural products and
speciality foods enjoyed a keen reception from the public Tuesday on
the opening day of the four-day 2004 Tokyo International Food
Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
National Policy Advisor and Taiwan Confectionery Biscuit and
Floury Food Industry Association Chairman Fang Jen-hui, who led the
Taiwan delegation composed of more than 150 representatives from 59
companies, said he is confident that Taiwan-made high-quality
foodstuffs will become more and more popular in Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to Fang, Taiwan-produced tea, vegetables and processed
foods are much improved in quality and representation this year and
are well-placed to court quality-conscious Japanese customers.
</P>
<P>
A variety of Taiwan vegetables, fruit, tea, processed produce and
alcoholic beverages are on display in a number of booths decorated in
an eye-catching livery of yellow, green and orange at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Trade Center (TTC) in Tokyo also sponsored a news
conference earlier that same day to introduce Taiwan's progress and
achievements in food safety.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ming-lai, director of the International Cooperation
Department under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) ,
hailed Taiwan fruit such as bananas, pineapples, dates and bell fruit
as "the world's top delicacies."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that exports of these fruits to Japan are
blocked because of a spate of quarantine requirements imposed by
Japan. Taiwan will continue to negotiate with Japan over the issue,
the COA official said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also noted that the COA is planning to earmark about NT$2.2
billion (NT$66 million) over the next three years to help Taiwan
agricultural and farm groups take part in international promotion
campaigns and set up marketing and distribution centers overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to TTC Director Huang Hsiao-kuan, it is very important
for Taiwan to open a distribution and sales center in Tokyo, on the
grounds that Japan is the largest outlet for Taiwan-produced
agricultural and farm produce. He claimed that such establishments
will be seen in Tokyo this year.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
he has no intention of immediately appointing a woman to serve as
premier if he is elected in the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The president was responding to questions about his remarks on
Women's Day when he was interviewed by TVBS, a local cable television
station, where he said he was keeping an eye out for a suitable woman
to fill the post of premier.
</P>
<P>
The president denied that his remarks were "a spur of the moment
whim, " saying that as a national leader, he has to be "careful with
his words and deeds."
</P>
<P>
He said, "To let women have more and better chances to take part
in public affairs has long been my thinking, " citing as an example
his choice of Annette Lu as his running mate this year as well as in
the previous presidential election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Inviting a woman to serve as premier has been a long-term
consideration, but will not be immediately acted upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that having a woman premier will first need proper
grooming and preparations. Chen also said, "I have no specific
candidate in mind, and, at any rate, nothing will be done about this
immediately following my re-election."
</P>
<P>
Moreover the president said, Premier Yu Shyi-kun is doing fine
and the March 20 presidential election will also be a vote of trust

PRESIDENT CHEN PROUD OF HIS  INTEGRITY, MORALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday what
he is most proud of in his more than 20-year political career is his
integrity and moral character.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the TVBS cable television station,
Chen said he can withstand the most stringent integrity and moral
examinations.
</P>
<P>
"Integrity is my self-discipline. Otherwise, I could not have won
the presidency. And I have required my working partners to meet the
same integrity and moral standards," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
For him, Chen went on, moral character and integrity are more
important than capabilities.
</P>
<P>
"I have full confidence and trust in individual members of my
administrative team. If any of them has integrity problems, I would
not wait until detractors launched an attack. I would take action
immediately after I detected the problems," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure as Taipei mayor from 1994 through 1998, Chen
recalled that some of his close aides were accused of having taken
bribes. "But judicial authorities have cleared their names. None of
them have ever been convicted of corruption or wrongdoing."
</P>
<P>
Since he took the presidency, Chen said his administrative team
has also passed scrutiny. "Over the past four years, I have taken
pride in the fact that all members of my administrative team have
withstood the harshest integrity tests."
</P>
<P>
As the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) doesn't have any
party enterprises or assets, Chen said, he has had to rely on
political contributions to finance his campaign for city council and
legislative seats, mayorship and the presidency over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that he is a principled man, Chen said donations must
be based on support for his political ideals or vision. "Donations
should not have any conditions. Otherwise, I would not accept them.
Donations can never be used as a tool to gain illegal benefits. I'm
unlikely to coddle donors' irregularities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said he thinks it is inappropriate for his wife
to conduct stock trading.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I have made a public apology for her stock trading
activities. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean that she has done
anything wrong in her stock trading deals. It's not an issue of
legality or unlawfulness. I have made an apology mainly because I
don't want the controversy to continue raging," Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
Chen apologized for the first lady's stock trading activities in
a televised debate with opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, the
sole challenger to his re-election bid, in February. He also promised
that his wife will not engage in any stock trading deals before the
March 20 presidential election and that his family assets will be put
into "blind trust" after the election.

AIRLINES POISED TO ADD FLIGHTS TO RETURN TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN TO VOTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the March 20 presidential election
approaching, carriers plying routes between Taiwan and Hong Kong and
Macau are poised to add flights to carry mainland-based Taiwan
businessmen to return home to vote, according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
To cope with a larger number of Taiwan businessmen expected to
return home for the presidential vote this year, airlines will set
their eyes particularly at the business opportunities generating from
the southern Pearl River Delta area, where many Taiwan businessmen
are also clustered now, in addition to the greater Shanghai area
surrounding the Yangzhijiang River Delta in central Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. have respectively
launched joint air-land and air-sea transport packages to carry
Taiwan businessmen who arrive in Hong Kong or Macau from mainland
China back to Taiwan in the run-up to the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
EVA Airways Corp. said it is planning to add nine flights on its
Hong Kong-Taiwan and Macau-Taiwan routes prior to the presidential
election to serve the many homecoming Taiwan businessmen and overseas
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
CAL said booking for seats on board flights back to Taiwan from
North America, Hong Kong and Macau before the March 20 presidential
election day are about 80 percent full, a level similar to its
average passenger load.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, some Taiwan businessmen and their families
based in Suzhou and Kunshan in Jiangsu province have already returned
to Taiwan in order to cast their ballots in the presidential
election. Some of them bought airplane tickets at lower rates.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, many Taiwan business people
with operations in mainland China had voiced the hope for airlines to
launch special charters or additional flights to carry them back home
to vote.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that around 100,000 mainland-headquartered Taiwan
businessmen will go back to Taiwan for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san also
suggested recently that Taiwan businessmen can come home via the
"mini three links"-- direct trade and transport service maintained
between Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and two ports in Fujian
province from Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The "mini three links" facilities on the two outlying islands are
capable of allowing in 200,000 people in three days, Lin said.

CHEN-LU TICKET ENJOYS NARROW LEAD: DPP POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ticket of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu enjoyed a narrow lead over the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" ticket in the latest public opinion poll, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The DPP conducted the telephone survey of adult residents
in various parts of the island from March 6-7. A total of
1,864 valid samples were collected. The poll has a margin of
error of 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the last opinion poll to be conducted by the DPP ahead of
the March 20 presidential election. According to the election law, no
one is allowed to public opinion poll results within 10 days before
the presidential election day.
</P>
<P>
Poll results showed that the Chen-Lu ticket has a support
rating of 39.1 percent, compared to 38 percent for the "pan-blue
alliance" ticket of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning their running mates, Chen's support rating was
37.6 percent, compared to Lien's 36.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the Chen-Lu ticket's 1.1 percent lead over the Lien-Soong
ticket fell with the margin of sampling error, DPP spokesman Chen
Chun-lin said, the presidential race is still too close to call.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chun-lin said the DPP expects that the voter turn out
to reach 81 percent this year, compared to 82 percent in the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"We also estimate that the Chen-Lu ticket will garner 51.1
percent of the vote, or 6.8 million ballots, compared to the
Lien-Soong's 48.9 percent, or 6.5 million votes," predicted Chen
Shun-lin.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 30.3 percent said they believe the Chen-Lu
ticket will be re-elected, while 36.3 percent said they think
that the Lien-Soong will win.
</P>
<P>
"In the series of DPP polls, the Chen-Lu ticket had consistently
trailed the Lien-Soong ticket by more than 20 percent in
success probability. This time around, the gap has narrowed to 6
percent," Chen Chun-lin claimed.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 90.4 percent of the respondents said they
will definitely or probably cast ballots in the presidential election
and only 8.4 percent said they will definitely or probably not go to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
As to the referendum to be held alongside the presidential
election, only 51.9 percent said they will definitely or probably
take part in the referendum, while 42.2 percent said they will
definitely or probably not cast referendum ballots.
</P>
<P>
A cross-analysis of poll results showed that nearly 90 percent of
supporters of various political parties have expressed their
choices, Chen Chun-lin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the poll found that the gap between Hakka people's
support ratings for the two tickets has narrowed to 4 percent,
with the 36.8 percent of Hakka respondents throwing support for
the Chen-Lu ticket and 40.8 percent backing the Lien-Soong
ticket.
</P>
<P>
Among voters in the 20-29 age group, 46.9 percent said they will
vote for the Chen-Lu ticket, compared to 39.8 percent who said
they support the Lien-Soong ticket.
</P>
<P>
By constituencies, the support ratings of the Chen-Lu and
Lien-Soong tickets were 37.9 percent vs. 39.3 percent in the Taipei
City-Taipei County constituency; 31.1 percent vs. 44.5 percent in the
Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miali area; 38.3 percent vs. 36.4 percent in the
Taichung-Changhua-Nantou region; 45 percent vs. 30.7 percent in
the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan constituency; 47.6 percent vs. 37.7
percent in the Kaohsiung City-Kaohsiung County-Pingtung County area;
and 28.2 percent vs. 42.3 percent in the eastern Taiwan region.

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will continue to push to join the
World Health Organization (WHO) every year, an official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ching-lung, deputy head of MOFA's Non-governmental
Organization Affairs Committee, spoke in the wake of President Chen
Shui-bian's recent remarks that he will work to have Taiwan included
in the world health body within two years if he is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that he himself traveled to Geneva, Switzerland several
times on behalf of the government to attend the WHO's annual
conference to lobby WHO members to support Taiwan's bid. He was happy
to hear President Chen's announcement, adding that MOFA and the
Department of Health will work toward achieving the goal.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the international community has formed a consensus
on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations'-affiliated organization.
Though mainland China will continue to relentlessly squeeze Taiwan,
Lu said it will be impossible to shut Taiwan out of the WHO.
</P>
<P>
He said MOFA has solicited the support of WHO members using every
possible channel, and has received positive responses.
</P>
<P>
Though Taiwan's chances of joining the WHO is greater now than
before, he said he wants to remind the public to refrain from
unreasonable expectations, adding that whether Taiwan can join the
WHO will depend on getting the most support from WHO members.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that though it is important to provide medical
resources and talent to the world, the more important thing is the
adherence to ideals, adding that Taiwan will continue to promote its
bid to join the WHO every year.

DPP TO HOLD LARGE RALLIES PRIOR TO MARCH 20 ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) hopes to attract half a million supporters at a rally in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan on Saturday, the same day that the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" has announced it will hold its own
islandwide rallies.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, a top DPP campaign manager, said Tuesday that
there will also be a number of large rallies in central and northern
Taiwan to drum up support for President Chen Shui-bian's re-election
bid prior to the March 20 election.
</P>
<P>
The rallies will be held in Taichung March 14 and Taipei March
19, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The large rallies will follow the more than one million people
who came out to support a "Yes Taiwan" event that saw DPP supporters
form a "hand-in-hand" human chain that stretched the length of Taiwan
on Feb. 28. Analysts said the event boosted President Chen's support.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the theme of the Kaohsiung rally will be "joy, hope, and
sailing to the world, " with 500,000 people marching in a joyful
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
To highlight the previous Kuomintang (KMT) administration's tacit
acceptance of "black gold, " or corrupt politics, Lee said 1,000
pictures portraying images of "black gold" practices will be
displayed at the rally and will include the pictures of Taiwan's 10
most wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
Also, a "The world is watching Taiwan's first [referendum]" night
will be held in Kaohsiung Saturday night, Lee said, adding that the
design of the show will be the "most creative and most touching"
since the inception of the DPP in 1986, with a classical arch gate
and many earth designs to show in a carnival atmosphere that Taiwan,
with imagination, will walk toward a new era and a new future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the night will highlight Taiwan people's right to
initiative and hold referendums, something that is stipulated in the
Republic of China Constitution but that has been denied the people
for years. The event will show that that right has been given back to
the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
People dressed as dolphins and whales will mingle with the crowd
to use images of the ocean and endangered animals to illustrate that
Taiwan is an ocean country and that an ocean country is sailing
toward the world.
</P>
<P>
Lee stressed that President Chen, Vice President Annette Lu, five
top campaign aides and DPP heavyweights Yu Shyi-kun, Chang
Chun-hsiung, Chiou I-jen, Su Tseng-chang and Frank Hsieh will lead
teams to attend the gathering and demonstrate the solidarity within
the party.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui will also be on hand to speak about
defending "native" government, in contrast with the "alien" regime of
the KMT, and the significance of the first referendum in Taiwan.

DELINKING MILITARY AND POLITICS GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT: PRESIDENT CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday
that eliminating political influence in the military, which was
common in the previous Kuomintang (KMT) administration, has been the
greatest achievement in his political career as head of state.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an exclusive interview with TVBS, a local cable
TV channel, Chen said that he saw to it that a new act passed in
early 2002 to integrate the military command and its administration
system be implemented and that the armed forces remain neutral,
without political affiliations or serving any political parties.
</P>
<P>
This achievement has been manifested in various elections in
Taiwan over the past several years, representing a stark contrast to
the situation before 2000 where the military was mostly designed to
serve the then-ruling KMT in every area, including elections, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the president said he feels sorry for every member of
his administration for having to put up with KMT presidential
candidate Lien Chan's ridicule. Lien commented recently that Chen's
administration was filled with people who " know and do nothing
except eat and sleep."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the president said, everyone on his
administrative team have sacrificed their time for eating and
sleeping to serve the people and the government, all for a single
cause -- to make Taiwan a better place to live.

Coast guard officers seized three
well-educated female illegal mainland Chinese immigrants in the
southern Taiwan city of Chiayi Tuesday, all of whom claimed they were
tricked into coming to Taiwan to work as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
The three mainland women, surnamed Yu, Lin and Liu, were seized
at a sex joint disguised as an automobile maintenance shop.
</P>
<P>
During questioning, the trio told coast guard officers that they
were tricked, claiming that they didn't know before coming to Taiwan
late last year that they would be forced to work as prostitutes upon
their arrival.
</P>
<P>
They said they felt a sense of liberation when they were seized
by law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
Yu is a junior college graduate, while Lin graduated from Sichuan
Normal University and once taught at a mainland school, and Liu was a
senior student at Anhui Normal University.
</P>
<P>
The trio will be sent to a detention center for illegal mainland
immigrants and will be repatriated at a later date, coast guard
officers said.

OPPOSITION PUSHES FOR LEGISLATIVE REFORMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislators from the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party on Wednesday
pushed for three constitutional and legislative reform programs in
the first meeting of the newly-established Committee for
Constitutional Amendment.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers pushed for a "single seat, two
votes" electoral system in order to strengthen the country's
democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under a "single seat, two votes" system with smaller electoral
districts, there is only one parliamentary seat up for grabs in each
constituency, and a voter can cast two ballots -- one for an
individual candidate and one for a political party.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers also pushed for passage of the
proposal to halve the number of seats in the Legislative Yuan to 113
seats -- a proposal that both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the opposition camp have agreed to.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" legislators also pushed a proposal that
would be conducive to increasing the ratio of women lawmakers in the
Legislative Yuan to about one-third, labeling this as "genuine gender
equality."
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, the legislative whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said the day before that it is
hoped that the proposal to halve the number of seats in the
Legislature will be passed before the March 20 presidential election
now that both the ruling DPP and the opposition parties have reached
consensus on it.
</P>
<P>
Other details of the amendment can be discussed after the
presidential election, Tsai added.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Liao Feng-teh said that the amendment needs to be
debated thoroughly and that legislators should be allowed to air
their views freely.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hsieh Chang-chieh, PFP convener at the Legislative
Yuan, said the chaos in the Legislature cannot be addressed simply by
cutting the number of legislators and added that other issues, such
as the length of terms for lawmakers and the relationship between the
executive and legislative branches, should also be attended to.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said he opposes the DPP's idea of tying constitutional
reform to the presidential election.

PRESIDENT REITERATES DETERMINATION TO PURSUE CROSS-STRAIT PEACE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his
determination Wednesday to pursue cross-Taiwan Strait peace and
called on the public to vote in the referendum to be held alongside
the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is seeking re-election in the upcoming presidential
race, said at a campaign rally held on the Taiwan-controlled
frontline island of Kinmen that cross-strait peace is the best
guarantee for the security and prosperity of Kinmen, which is located
only a few kilometers off the southeast coast of mainland China.
</P>
<P>
The main purposes of holding the referendum are to demonstrate
Taiwan people's sentiment against the mainland Chinese missile threat
and their resolve to pursue cross-strait peace, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has deployed 496 missiles targeting Taiwan and continues
to increase the number of missiles at a pace of one every six days,
Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
He urged Kinmen residents to be vigilant against the mainland
Chinese missile threat despite the opening of so-called "mini three
links" with mainland China since January 2001 because Beijing has
never abandoned its hostility toward Taiwan and the island cannot
ward off the missile attacks once a cross-strait war erupts.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that being the country's leader, he wishes to be a
builder of Taiwan-centric consciousness, the terminator of corrupt
"black gold" politics, the initiator of Taiwan's democratic reforms,
the defender of justice and fairness and the maker of cross-strait
peace.

FOURTH REFERENDUM DEBATE PITS LAWMAKER AGAINST SCHOLAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislator Chuo Jong-tai of the Democratic
Progressive Party debated Juan Ming, a professor at Tamkang
University on Wednesday over the second question in the referendum:
whether the country should negotiate with Beijing for peace.
</P>
<P>
Although Juan claimed afterward the event that he was the only
"real" debater on the opposition side of the four rounds of debates
held up to now since all the previous opposition speakers disputed
the legal basis for the whole referendum rather than the questions
asked in it. Chuo said he considered himself fortunate to debate
against the ex-aide to Beijing's defamed leader, Zhao Ziyang, because
"we share more points of view than we differ on."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chuo made a strong case for the legality of the
referendum, saying that Beijing's 496 missiles targeting Taiwan are a
persistent threat to the country and are a justification for the
president's initiation of a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He denounced some critics' calls to boycott the referendum,
saying that to refuse to vote in the referendum would be a slap in
face to a hard-earned right, and a travesty to democracy.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the whole world is looking to the results of the
March 20 referendum, Chuo said a "yes" vote on this question will
send a strong message across the world that the country loves peace,
and resents Beijing's missile threat.
</P>
<P>
Chuo said talking with Beijing on an equal footing is the only
option for the country, adding that he believes his party has the
capability to carry this out, and looks forward to the day when
President Chen Shui-bian and Beijing's leader, Hu Jingtao, will shake
hands on an international occasion and talk about the future of
Taiwan and the mainland. When that day comes, Chen and Hu will be the
favorite candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, Chuo claimed.
</P>
<P>
Juan agreed with all of Chou's views about the legality and
necessity of the referendum and only took issue with any suggestion
of talking with Beijing for peace, claiming "this will only lead to
Taiwan falling into Beijing's 'one-China' trap."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the Chinese Civil War took place on the mainland
between the communists and the Kuomintang (KMT) and has nothing to do
with Taiwan, which is an independent democratic country. Taiwan is
not in a belligerent state with mainland China and accordingly there
is no point in talking about setting up a peaceful framework with
Beijing as the question in the referendum asks.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Juan claimed Taiwan wouldn't succeed in negotiating
peace with Beijing because Beijing would demand Taiwan accept its
territorial claim to the island and, as with any military hegemony,
would not bother to fulfill its own commitment, should it make any,
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning the name of KMT presidential candidate Lien
Chan, he called the idea advocated by Lien dangerous, that of
negotiations with Beijing by setting aside the thorny issue of
Taiwan's sovereignty, because, he said, it will inevitably undermine
Taiwan's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
A more practical way would be to negotiate with Beijing regarding
the economy, and environmental protection and culture, with the
purpose of improving people's wellbeing, Juan said.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, Taiwan's only hope for peace with mainland
China is the democratization of the mainland, then Taipei can start
to negotiate with Beijing for peace.
</P>
<P>
Although opposing the idea of negotiating with Beijing, Juan said
he supports the referendum itself, saying it is a way of gauging
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
With this right in hand, Juan said, the people can force the
government to change its policy towards mainland China to better
serve the country's interests, Juan said.

PROS, CONS EXCHANGED IN DEBATE ON PURCHASE OF ANTI-MISSILE EQUIPMENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two debaters expressed their pros and cons
in a televised debate Wednesday over the question of Taiwan's
anti-missile military procurement, one of the two questions to be
raised in a referendum planned for March 20 to coincide with the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
You Ching, a lawmaker and veteran member of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party who represented the affirmative side, said that
Taiwan should further step up its defensive capabilities to counter
the increased missile threats from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
In the face of continued missile threat from the mainland, Taiwan
has to purchase more anti-missile equipment and a "yes" vote on the
referendum question will help underscore to the world the resolve of
the people of Taiwan to safeguard the country, and will be heard
particularly by mainland China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that it is commonly hoped that disputes between
Taiwan and mainland China should be settled peacefully, You urged the
public to cast a "yes" vote on the referendum question should the
mainland continue refusing to renounce the use of force against
Taiwan and not remove its missiles aimed at the island.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Chinese Communists have been relentlessly
building up their military, You pointed out that the number of
missiles deployed by Beijing targeting Taiwan will increase from the
current level of 496 missiles to 600 next year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to developing an anti-missile system, You contended
that the people in Taiwan should also build their own psychological
firewall to confront the mainland faced with such a difficult
situation.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan is incapable of developing its own defensive
weapons like the United States or Russia, You said purchasing more
effective anti-missile facilities is a necessary and priority option
for the country to safeguard its own security in view of continued
military intimidation from mainland China, unless Taiwan is willing
to kowtow to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a prosperous economy, a strong national defense will
also be one useful and last bargaining chip for Taiwan at the
negotiating table, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Kao Cheng-yen, a professor at National Taiwan
University and a long-time environmental protection activist of the
Green Party who represented the negative side, pointed out that the
top priority now is to seek ways to dilute mainland China's
hostilities toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Only when there is genuine democracy or opposition parties are
lawful in the mainland will it be possible for the Beijing regime to
forswear its military threats against Taiwan, " Kao argued and added
that, "Taiwan must not skip its role in mainland China's
democratization."
</P>
<P>
Kao said he is strongly opposed to Taiwan's increased spending in
military weapons and that he favors the idea of developing indigenous
deterrent arms if the nation has to beef up its own defense
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The Green Party has long been keen to make Taiwan into a neutral
and nuclear-free homeland and is supportive of using the money for
weapons to build a green and peaceful homeland in Taiwan where
sustainable progress and development can be secured, he said.
</P>
<P>
The You-Kao debate is the fourth round of five encounters between
the supporters and opponents of the question to be included in
Taiwan's first nationwide referendum.

225-SEAT LEGISLATURE TO BE REDUCED TO 113 SEATS IN 2008
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to repeated calls for changes
and reforms in the Legislative Yuan, a committee at the legislature
on Wednesday passed a draft constitutional amendment to halve the
current 225-seat legislature, although the decision will only be put
into practice in 2008.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft amendment, starting from 2008, the current
225 seats in the legislature will be cut to 113, and the number of
legislators elected in the year-end election this year will not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the current practice of multiple legislators elected
from a single constituency will be changed to a "one seat, two votes"
system, meaning one vote for an individual candidate and another vote
for a political party.
</P>
<P>
The at-large and overseas Chinese seats will be set at 34, women
legislators make up no fewer than 34, and the term of the
legislators will be lengthened to four years from the current three
years.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which held its first meeting Wednesday, reviewed
12 constitutional amendment proposals. Legislative terms, the number
of seats in the legislature, and the adjustment of constituencies
were high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
This is the first of nine issues to be dealt with concerning
constitutional reform and the committee will continue to review the
other eight, which include the presidential election system and the
confirmation of the premier. After the completion of the review of
the nine issues, they will be sent together to the legislature for a
second and third reading.
</P>
<P>
According to the organization law of the committee, the committee
is in charge of the review of constitutional amendment proposals and
other matters related to the Republic of China Constitution. There
are 114 members in the committee, and there are 11 conveners.
</P>
<P>
The conveners held a meeting last week during which they agreed
that starting from March 10, the committee will hold a meeting every
Wednesday to discuss constitutional amendment proposals.
</P>
<P>
As the committee passed the first reading of the constitutional
amendment to halve the legislative seats, Lin Yi-hsiung, a former
chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and his
supporters were staging the last day of their 10-day fast relay
activity outside the legislature.
</P>
<P>
They wanted to highlight their cause to require all political
parties to pass a resolution to ask their members to adhere to party
policy and pass the constitutional amendment by March 20 to allow the
halving of the number of legislative seats.

TASK FORCE WILL OVERSEE STEEL ISSUES DUE TO DOMESTIC SHORTAGE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Economic Affairs decided
Wednesday to set up a cross-departmental task force this week to
monitor wholesale prices and supply and demand issues relating to
steel in response to Taiwan's shortage and concerns from downstream
companies.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Development Bureau Director-General Chen Chao-yih said
that the shortage of steel was mainly because of low demand after the
outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) early last
year, and the high demand in mainland China recently for
infrastructure needed for construction in the build-up to the 2008
Beijing Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Another contributing factor to the current domestic shortfall of
steel is the fact that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) coordinated with steel-manufacturing countries
three years ago to reduce steel output by five million tons, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
To address the need for more steel in Taiwan, China Steel Corp.
-- the largest steel producer in Taiwan -- has increased production
from 10.4 million tons in 2002 to 11 million tons in 2004 with the
extra 0.6 million tons earmarked for exclusive use by domestic
companies. Additionally, the corporation's export volume has been cut
this year to 24 percent from the previous level of 30 percent, Chen
added.
</P>
<P>
Chen also pointed out that banning steel exports, a move called
for by some legislators, would be counterproductive since the steel
market is a global one and Taiwan's withdrawal from world trade would
adversely impact the development of the island's international steel
market.

REPRESENTATIVES OF JAPANESE ENTERPRISES VISIT KINMEN

<TEXT>
<P>
A score of representatives from Japanese
enterprises expressed hope Wednesday that foreign tourists can ply
the direct transport links between Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen
and the nearby mainland Chinese port of Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of such Japanese enterprises as Kobe Steel
and NYK Logistics &amp; Megacarrie, led by Masaaki Ohari, a secretary of
Japanese Dietman Teru Fukui, called on Kinmen County Magistrate Lee
Chu-feng to exchange views with him on investment in Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
Fukui visited Kinmen in January, when he showed keen interest in
Kinmen's promotion of a plan to build a bridge to link Kinmen and
Xiamen, the sale of Kinmen's Kaoliang (sorghum) liquor in Japan, as
well as tourism promotion. He helped arrange the visit of the
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The representatives noted that Tokyo at present has three flights
to Xiamen daily and said that if Japanese tourists can travel by ship
to Kinmen for tourism, it would save them money and time as they
would not have to visit Taiwan proper before proceeding to Kinmen.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that more than 200,000 foreign tourists go to Xiamen
every year and said Kinmen county officials hope they can also travel
between Xiamen and Kinmen. He claimed that technical issues would not
be a problem, but said the matter will hinge on Taiwan government
policy.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Kinmen county officials, the representatives
toured a site for a hotel, where they were surprised to find that it
will be built by digging directly into granite.

CROSS-STRAIT EXCAVATOR THEFT RING BUSTED

<TEXT>
<P>
Four men believed to be involved in a
cross-Taiwan Strait excavator theft ring have been nabbed on charges
of theft, fraud and smuggling, Kaohsiung police authorities reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a raid on a warehouse in Kaohsiung's Chiching Port Tuesday
evening, police arrested the four men and seized three excavators and
a 25-ton crane with a combined value of over NT$10 million.
</P>
<P>
The men, all of whom have criminal records, were discovered to
have stolen excavators, bulldozers, cranes and other heavy
construction machinery from all over Taiwan, which they would smuggle
to mainland China via the Republic of China-held outlying island of
Matsu.
</P>
<P>
Operating under the name of a maritime engineering company, the
four men first stole the heavy-duty machines from construction sites
and then smuggled them to Kaohsiung, before shipping them to Matsu,
where the stolen machines would be ferried to the mainland for sale,
according to the police.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 such machines have been stolen in central Taiwan
over the past several months and police believe that all the machines
have ended up on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The police found that the maritime engineering company has
applied many times to transport excavators, cranes and bulldozers to
Matsu for maritime engineering projects.

TAIPOWER URGES PYONGYANG TO OFFER WORLD-STANDARD NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said Wednesday
that North Korea should provide it with an exclusive nuclear waste
dump in line with international requirements to facilitate the
enforcement of a radioactive waste disposal contract between the
company and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Taipower was responding to a South Korean news report that
Pyongyang has threatened to take the case to an international court
if Taipower fails to deliver nuclear waste to North Korea for
permanent disposal by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's state-owned power firm signed a contract with North
Korea through a private broker in January 1997 that allows Taipower to
ship up to 60,000 barrels of low-grade radioactive waste from its
three nuclear power plants to North Korea for permanent disposal. But
the contract has so far not been implemented due to strong opposition
from South Korea and protests from international environmental
groups.
</P>
<P>
According to the South Korean news report, Pyongyang's national
nuclear security supervisory commission recently sent a letter to
Taipower protesting its delay in implementing the contract and
describing Taipower's complaint that the North Korean facility is
flawed as an "excuse."
</P>
<P>
The commission reportedly said in the letter that the storage
facility has been completed for a long time and that North Korea has
remodeled two military ships to deliver the waste. If Taipower fails
to deliver by the end of June, the commission said, it will file an
international lawsuit against Taipower and demand financial
compensation for North Korea's losses resulting from Taipower's
breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, a Taipower spokesman said its contract
with North Korea does not defined a time-frame for implementing the
contract provisions. Moreover, he went on, the contract clearly
stipulates that it will not take effect until both governments agree
to all the contract terms.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the contract will be implemented only after our
government issues an export permit and the North Korean government
issues an import license," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
While the North Korean government has issued an import permit,
Taiwan's Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council (AEC) has yet to issue
an export permit to Taipower.
</P>
<P>
"The AEC has expressed the hope that North Korea will provide
Taipower with an exclusive storage facility that meets international
safety requirements for nuclear waste disposal," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to international regulations, nuclear waste should not
be stored in the same facility with other waste. The Taipower
spokesman claimed that the North Korean facility does not meet this
standard, but he did not elaborate. He insisted that Taipower cannot
deliver its nuclear waste to North Korea until the AEC has issued an
export permit.
</P>
<P>
Taipower has been seeking a location to store its low-grade
nuclear waste as its contract to use scenic Orchid Island -- home to
the Tao aboriginal tribe -- as anuclear waste dump expired in 2002,
and the Tao people have protested bitterly over the company's failure
to remove the radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
Even though Taipower has signed contracts with Russia and North
Korea on treating its low-level radioactive waste, but environmental
impact issues have dampened Taipower's plans to ship its nuclear
waste to either of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Taipower has been evaluating 11 possible sites in various areas
of Taiwan, including Taitung's Taimali, Tajen, Chialan and Lichiu
townships, as well as Ilan's Nanao township, Pingtung's Shihtsu
and Mutan villages, and Hualien's Fuli township.
</P>
<P>
The company originally also surveyed several sites on Taiwan's
outlying islands, including the Penghu island group and the island of
Kueishan, off the coast of Ilan. But these islands were later
excluded from the list of possible sites.
</P>
<P>
Taipower has yet to announce where its new nuclear waste dump
will be located.

TAIWAN HOPES TO ATTRACT EUROPEAN TOURISTS WITH HOSPITALITY, ART
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris, March 9 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will try to attract more European
tourists with its delicios food, hospitality as well as the unique
artistic treasures of the National Palace Museum, Taiwan's top
tourism official said in Paris Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Su Cheng-tien, director general of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, made the remarks when
he and other Taiwan hoteliers attended a Taiwan tourism promotion
party at the Evergreen Laurel Hotel in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Su told more than 20 travel agents in Paris that Taiwan is a
haven for gourmet lovers as they can enjoy foods of various delicious
Chinese styles there.
</P>
<P>
The various kinds of temples in Taiwan, where people have
religious freedom, are closely intertwined with the lives of its
residents, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The National Palace Museum, with its priceless collection, is
widely considered one of the top four museums in the world, he said,
adding that French people, after visiting the Louvre Museum, should
not miss the National Palace Museum in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Beijing's museum, Taipei's National Palace Museum
is truly a major museum with a rich collection, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Su also spoke about the new trend of offering package tours
including Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China, saying that travel
agencies in the United States have offered tours including both sides
of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
For European tourists interested in Chinese culture, the
travel agencies can arrange tours for them that include mainland
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, or any of the two places, which he
said will be a boost to Taiwan tourism too.
</P>
<P>
Su also discussed the difficulties that need to be addressed
in attracting European tourists to Taiwan, saying the first factor is
higher prices when compared with mainland China and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Taiwan will strive to upgrade the quality of
its tourism, Su said, adding that it will try to establish a good
reputation instead of focusing on dramatically increasing the
number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the problem that many scenic spots in Taiwan are not
well known internationally, Taiwan will stress the island's
hospitality, appealing to them that Taiwan will be a place that
"touch your hearts."
</P>
<P>
The long distance between Taiwan and Europe is another
factor, Su said, expressing the hope that travel agencies will not
only promote trips to Taiwan alone, but combine Hong Kong or
mainland China in package tours to attract more European tourists.
</P>
<P>
Currently, European tourists visiting Taiwan have mainly come
from Britain, France and Germany.

POWELL REITERATES U.S. CROSS-STRAIT POLICY TO BEIJING OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington,  March 9 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U. S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
reiterated Washington's stance Tuesday to a visiting Beijing official
that the United States opposes any unilateral attempts to change the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Powell made the remarks during a meeting with mainland Chinese
Vice Foreign Minister Dai Binguo in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that the United States is opposed to any effort by
either Taiwan or mainland China to change the current cross-strait
situation, Powell voiced Washington's hope the two sides can mend
their disputes through peaceful means, such as dialogue.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher,
Powell and Dai exchanged views on various issues of mutual concern,
including those related to Taiwan and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Powell repeated to Dai that the United States has not deviated
from its "one China" policy framework, which is based on three
Washington - Beijing joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act,
Boucher said, adding that Dai was slated to meet Deputy Secretary of
State Richard Armitage later the same day.
</P>
<P>
Washington has come under strong pressure from Beijing over
Taiwan's planned March 20 referendum coinciding with its presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Although Beijing views the referendum as a covert move toward
Taiwan independence, senior U.S. officials, including Powell, have
made it clear that Taiwan, as a democratic society, is entitled to
hold such a public vote.

3% PAY RAISE FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL, CIVIL SERVANTS, TEACHERS MULLED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government is assessing a pay raise of
3 percent for the nation's military personnel, civil servants and
teachers next year, the Central Personnel Administration (CPA) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CPA officials noted that the government last raised the salary by
3 percent for those sectors in 2001, but has not made further
adjustments since because of the sluggish economic situation and
strained financial situation.
</P>
<P>
But after the three-year salary freeze, the government will
consider a pay hike in view of the economic recovery, adding that the
adjustment will take into consideration the salary level of private
enterprises, the fluctuation of the price index, the per capita
income, economic growth as well as the financial burden of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The CPA'a announcement came after opposition presidential
candidate Lien Chan appealed to military personnel, civil servants
and teachers with campaign promises, including a pay raise for
lower-ranking personnel bringing salaries to twice the per capita
income.
</P>
<P>
CPA Director-General Lee Yi-yang lashed out at the proposal,
saying that it would make Taiwan the country with the highest
personnel expenditure, which is "irresponsible" and could "plunge the
country into heavy debt."
</P>
<P>
CPA officials said that statistics released by the Directorate
General Budget, Accounting and Statistics show that per capita income
in Taiwan in 2003 was NT$395,746 (US$11,920) . While lower-ranking
civil servants now get NT$512,474 annually on average if calculated
by 14.5 months of payment, which is 1.29-fold the per capita income,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Middle-ranking civil servants receive an average of NT$763,606,
or 1.93-fold the per capita income, while high-ranking civil servants
receive an average NT$114.4833, or 2.89-fold the per capita income,
they added.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that if salaries for lower-ranking civil
servants are raised to twice the per capita income, pay for middle-
and high-ranking civil servants will also have to be raised, and even
if counted in the most conservative way, the government would have to
increase its expenditure by NT$190.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that personnel expenses in the central
government currently account for 25.8 percent of the total
expenditure, while personnel expenses in local government is as high
as 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an opposition Kuomintang spokesman "elaborated" on
Lien's promise. Tsai Chen-yuan claimed that Lien's promise was
actually that if elected, he will improve the economy and the
benefits of the economic growth will be shared by military personnel,
civil servants and teachers, as well as farmers and laborers.

NATIONAL COFFERS GREATLY INCREASED IN FEBRUARY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taxes funnelled into the national coffers
in February totaled NT$71.1 billion (US$2.14 billion) , up by 50.4
percent over the year-earlier level, the Ministry of Finance reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tax revenues generated by stock transaction deals reached NT$10.7
billion last month, a monthly high since February 2002 and
representing a 2.7-fold rise compared to the previous year's record,
which is also a new single-month high since March 2000, ministry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the big jump in February stock
transaction taxes to a bullish stock market as a result of recovering
business conditions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, land value increment tax revenue also grew by NT$4.2
billion year-on-year to NT$7.5 billion in February thanks to a
government policy that provides a 50 percent cutback in such taxes,
income from which hit a record high of NT$10.05 billion in December
last year.
</P>
<P>
The policy of halving the land value increment tax was originally
to have expired in January, but the Legislative Yuan recently decided
to extend it for another one year.

PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTS NULL AND VOID IF CAST IN WRONG BOXES: CEC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Election Commission (CEC) is
likely to decide that March 20 presidential election ballots will
become null and void if they are cast in the wrong boxes, such as the
ballot boxes to be used for the accompanying referendum, CEC Chairman
Huang Shih-cheng said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that although the presidential votes cast in the wrong
boxes are likely to be counted as invalid -- a final decision will be
made Thursday afternoon -- the two referendum votes, designed to let
voters say "yes" or "no" to two referendum propositions -- will be
counted as valid even if they are cast in the wrong referendum boxes.
</P>
<P>
In the nation's first-ever nationwide referendum, voters will be
asked two questions -- whether Taiwan should buy more anti-missile
batteries in the face of Beijing's missile threat and whether Taiwan
should negotiate a viable interactive mechanism with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Huang also said that the CEC might also decide Thursday that
voters' ID cards will be marked only once after they register at
polling stations for ballots, regardless of whether they decide to
receive one or three ballots.
</P>
<P>
The polling station layout will also be designed to allow voters
to accept and cast their presidential ballots and referendum ballots
in two different directions, although at the same polling station,
Huang added.
</P>
<P>
These measures, he said, are designed to facilitate a smooth
election day and speedy vote-counting, Huang stressed.
</P>
<P>
As the presidential election is scheduled to be held in tandem
with the referendum, questions and concerns surrounding electoral
affairs have been rife over the past several months.
</P>
<P>
Confusion over how voters should cast their presidential election
ballots and referendum votes and how the polling stations should be
designed have caused heated debate islandwide over the past month and
even caused Miaoli County Election Commission Chairman Ku Cheng-ching
to resign.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" expressed satisfaction Wednesday with Huang's
remarks.

WELFARE GROUPS RAISE FUNDS TO HELP FOREIGN BIRD FLU VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Taiwan men married to Thai and
Vietnamese women launched a fund-raising drive Wednesday in
cooperation with several local civic organizations to help their
spouses' next of kin having been affected by recent avian flu
outbreaks in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chien Chih-jung, a Taiwan citizen with a Vietnamese spouse, said
at a news conference that many families in Vietnam and Thailand have
been affected by the outbreaks due to mandatory culling of their
fowl.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Chien said, his wife's aunt originally made a
living raising 300 chickens. In Vietnam, a single chicken can fetch
NT$21 (US$0.63).
</P>
<P>
"Her family now faces an economic crisis as her chickens have
been culled amid the bird flu scare, " Chien said, adding that many
other families in Vietnam and Thailand face a similar plight.
</P>
<P>
Chien said he will mobilize more Taiwanese men with Vietnamese
and Thai spouses to donate funds to help their foreign in-laws and
other relatives affected by the avian flu outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eden Social Welfare Foundation said it has joined
forces with Chien's group and several other local private
organizations to raise funds for avian flu victims in Vietnam and
northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The foundation said it has so far raised NT$200,000. Under the
fund-raising program, the foundation plans to offer US$50 to each
Vietnamese and Thai relative by marriage.
</P>
<P>
"For many Taiwan people, US$50 is not a large sum, but it can
finance two months of living expenses in Vietnam and northern
Thailand, " an Eden spokesman said, adding that local citizens are
welcome to contribute funds to the charity campaign.

LIFTING FIRST-PHASE WATER RESTRICTIONS TO BE DECIDED BY LATE MARCH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to adequate rainfall from late
January, the water levels of reservoirs nationwide have risen to
normal levels, securing supplies through late May, government water
resources authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision made during a national anti-drought
meeting a day earlier called by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA), the anti-drought task force will hold a meeting in late March
to decide when to lift the first-phase water conservation measures --
a reduction in water pressure during off-peak hours -- in place in
northern Taiwan and on outlying Penghu Island since early May last
year.
</P>
<P>
The task force members will discuss the issue by that time if
rainfall in the coming days reaches the average level of the past,
officials of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the MOEA said.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the amount of water stored in the major
reservoirs in northern and central regions is a little more than the
year-earlier level.
</P>
<P>
The Feitsui reservoir in Taipei County and the Shihmen reservoir
in Taoyuan County -- the two main providers for northern Taiwan --
have a combined 234 million tons of water, up by more than 100
million tons from the level registered late last year.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that water supplies for the greater Taipei
and Taoyuan areas will remain normal through May, while water use in
eastern Ilan and Hualien has also been ensured for the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Supplies for residents in Hsinchu and the neighboring central
region have also been secured through June, as the Yungheshan
reservoir in Hsinchu County has sufficient water, the WRA officials
said.
</P>
<P>
However, they pointed out that reservoirs in southern Taiwan have
fallen short of their normal levels, a situation that has led to the
implementation of a fallow program this spring and a cutback in water
supplies of between 5 percent and 20 percent for heavy users.
</P>
<P>
As for water shortage problems on Matsu and Penghu islands, some
5,000 tons of water will continue to be shipped to the two islands
from Taiwan twice every three days, they noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result of scarce rainfall in recent years, Taiwan, which is
used to abundant rainfall, has been seriously affected by a dry spell
over the past two years.

DPP CALLS FOR DELINKING OF POLITICS AND RELIGION

<P>
A legislative whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said the party hopes people will
keep religion and politics separate, particularly in the run-up to
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-lang said everybody in the country has
the constitutionally-protected right to freely express their will and
perspectives. The DPP, however, hopes that people won't bring
religion and politics together, he added.

Tsai made the remarks in response to reports that senior Zen

central Taiwan, openly stumped for the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
presidential ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party Chairman James Soong at a rally held Tuesday.

Wei Chueh reportedly ridiculed the referendum to be held

ballot on election day.

PRESIDENT URGES TAIWAN PEOPLE TO HELP IN SEARCH FOR MISSING U.S. MAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged local
people Thursday to assist in the search for an American citizen who
went missing in Taiwan last May.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the call in the latest issue of the "A-bian Electronic
Paper," an Internet newsletter named after Chen's nickname "A-bian."
</P>
<P>
Chen said in the weekly online publication that Barbara Klita
sent him a second letter recently asking for his assistance in the
search for her missing son, Fryderyk Mieszko Frontier.
</P>
<P>
In addition to directing relevant government agencies to step up
their search efforts, Chen said he hopes ordinary citizens can also
assist in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Those who have leads about Frontier's whereabouts are welcome to
contact relevant government authorities or inform Mrs. Klita, " Chen
said in the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
Klita sent her first letter to President Chen late last year.
Chen published that letter along with Frontier's photo and Klita's
e-mail address -- barbaraklita@collegeclub.com -- in the Dec. 18
issue of the A-bian Electronic Paper.
</P>
<P>
In her second letter to Chen, Klita expressed her gratitude for
the president's assistance and for all those who have assisted in the
search. She also expressed the hope that Taiwan's government and
people can continue to assist in the search.
</P>
<P>
Klita has made several visits to Taiwan to search for her son.
Just last Tuesday, she paid a visit to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu in
central Taiwan to ask for his assistance in her search for her
missing son.
</P>
<P>
Frontier arrived in Taiwan May 20, 2003, to take up an English
teaching job at a branch of the Hess Educational Organization in
Chungho, Taipei County, but did not show up for a pre-job training
program May 25 as originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
According to a National Police Administration (NPA) probe,
Frontier stayed at a Taipei hostel after his arrival in Taiwan. He
told a hostel information desk staffer that he was going to make a
trip to eastern Taiwan before reporting to Hess for work. Frontier
left his luggage at the Hess Chungho branch before departing for the
eastern county of Hualien.
</P>
<P>
NPA officials said Frontier stayed at the Catholic hostel in
Tienhsiang, in Taroko National Park, from May 21 through May 24. He
checked out of the hostel May 25 and has not been heard from since.
</P>
<P>
The NPA has said on many occasions that it has directed the
Hualien County Police Bureau and the Taroko National Park police to
step up the search for Frontier. Moreover, it urged local citizens to
come forward with any information they might have regarding his
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has information about the whereabouts of Frontier is
welcome to contact the NPA's foreign affairs office at (02) 2393-0989
or (02) 2394-0238, or the Hualien County Police Bureau at (03)
738-2000.
</P>
<P>
Frontier stands 186 cm tall, weighs 96 kilograms and has curly
brown hair, according to NPA data. He was 28 years old when he came
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the American Institute in
Taiwan in mid-July 2003, Frontier called his former roommate in the
United States May 22, saying that he was going to visit a national
park and return to Taipei May 25. He also expressed an interest in
going hiking and visiting the southern city of Kaohsiung.

BALLOTS CAST IN WRONG BOXES TO BE COUNTED: ELECTION COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the March 20 presidential election and
referendum, the ballots cast in the wrong boxes will be counted as
valid, the Central Election Commission (CEC) chief said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said that while it is unlikely that
ballots for the presidential election will be cast in the boxes
provided for the referendum ballots, or vise versa, any such vote
will still be counted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the outcome of the presidential election will have
to be announced twice. The first announcement will be made when all
ballots in the boxes for presidential election are tallied and the
second will be made when the boxes for referendum ballots are
counted, in case any presidential votes are found to have been cast
in the referendum boxes.
</P>
<P>
The CEC also decided not to mark voters' identification cards for
the election and referendum separately, in order to save time and to
prevent anyone from knowing voters' voting patterns.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Thursday, the Executive Yuan told the
CEC that invalid votes should be excluded while deciding the majority
of votes in the referendum, although they should be counted into the
overall turnout rate.
</P>
<P>
That means only the "yes" votes and the "no" votes will be
counted when deciding whether the referendum has passed or not.
</P>
<P>
But when it come to determining whether the referendum has
crossed the threshold of a 50 percent turnout rate needed for a
legally binding referendum, any invalid votes will be included.

TWO MEN INDICTED FOR SPYING FOR BEIJING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former civilian worker of the Military
Intelligence Bureau (MIB) was indicted Thursday by prosecutors for
spying for Beijing, along with another civilian MIB worker who was
accused of helping him.
</P>
<P>
In the indictment, the prosecutors claim that Tseng Chao-wen was
a civilian MIB worker who left the MIB in 1988. He was recruited in
1997 by a Beijing intelligence official -- whose identity is unknown
and who is identified only by his alias of Li Jing in the case -- to
collect general information about Taiwan for Beijing and was paid
US$30,000 between 1997 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the indictment said, Li asked Tseng to provide him with
information about MIB employees, especially secret agents' overseas
assignments.
</P>
<P>
Tseng used money provided by Li to wine and dine his former MIB
colleague Chen Hui-chun, and others, to pry information on the latest
assignments of MIB agents, which he then fed to Li in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Tseng was caught red handed in a convenience store while faxing
information to Beijing last November, and Chen was arrested later.
</P>
<P>
Both of them denied the charges, with Tseng claiming that the
so-called intelligence he collected was nothing but newspaper stories
and Chen claiming to have had no idea that Tseng was Beijing's spy.
He met with Tseng at ordinary social gatherings and discussed no
classified information during their chats, he said.
</P>
<P>
Their denials were dismissed by prosecutors, who claimed in the
indictment that the information transmitted by Tseng to Beijing had
been identified by the Ministry of National Defense as classified
information.
</P>
<P>
The two have been detained since November and if found guilty,
face up to seven years in prison.

SCHEME ROLLED OUT TO BOOST SERVICE INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Science and Technology Advisory Group
under the Executive Yuan rolled out a scheme Thursday designed to
boost the knowledge-type service industry over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference, group officials said that after two
seminars between December 2003 and March 2004, strategies and
timetables have been mapped out to promote export-oriented service
industry based on Taiwan's high-tech competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
During the first seminar, three goals were set -- to achieve a
knowledge-type service industry worth NT$6 trillion (US$180.18
billion) by 2010; to create more than 10 leading companies with
brands worth over NT$100 billion in the international market; and to
upgrade labor quality and expand job opportunities in the service
sector to account for 32.5 percent of all labor.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goals, the government will assign a minister
without portfolio to coordinate and promote related policies, while
the Council for Economic Planning and Development will be responsible
for coordinating the work of related government agencies, the
officials noted.
</P>
<P>
Also, they added, the government will promote a series of
programs, including a supply chain project, a project of research,
development and application of radio frequency identification, a
telecare project, an intergrated medical system and others.
</P>
<P>
During the second seminar, goals were also presented to develop
information service through integration; to upgrade the added value
of the manufacturing industry and the competitiveness of the service
industry; and to promote Taiwan as the main provider of information
services in globally specific areas.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, the government will push forth three to
five flagship development programs by the end of this year and will
promote the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)
certification system for improving the quality of the information
service industry, the officials added.

information on the implementation of other countries' constitutions.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution, which will be put to a referendum slated
for Dec. 10, 2006 for final approval, will decide a new governmental
regime and the relationship between the central and local
governments, among others, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
If approved, the new constitution will be promulgated May 20, 2007
and will go into effect May 20, 2008, she continued.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the governmental regime, the new constitution
should address many other issues, including the halving of the
225-seat legislature, reforms to the current military service system
and adoption of a two-layer or three-layer government, Lu went on.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution also should be in line with government
reforms, she said.
</P>
<P>
Besides political reforms, the vice president said, Taiwan also
needs spiritual, cultural and social reforms in the face of
increasing international competition and challenges.

PROTESTERS ENCIRCLE LEGISLATURE TO DEMAND HALVING OF LEGISLATURE

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of protesters mobilized by
various private groups besieged the Legislative Yuan Thursday,
demanding that the legislature approve a constitutional amendment to
allow a major downsizing of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
The protesters stood hand-in-hand and encircled the Legislative
Yuan to make their demand known -- legislative final approval for the
constitutional revision by the March 20 presidential election in
order to push for halving the number of seats in the 225-member
parliament to 113.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yi-hsiung, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), took part in the rally later the same day by
joining a sit-in and relay fast at the venue. Streamlining the
legislature has been one of the goals long sought by the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the protest announced that the demonstrations will
be prolonged through March 19 until their demand is heeded by the

RULING, OPPOSITION PARTIES TO TEST METTLE ON LEGISLATURE REFORMS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Thursday that a floor meeting of the Legislative Yuan
Friday will be a crucial battle for the passage of a draft
constitutional amendment concerning legislative reforms.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-lang, the DPP's legislative whip, noted that a
constitutional amendment committee passed the first reading of a
draft amendment of Article 4 of the Constitution concerning the
legislative term, number of seats and adjustment of constituencies,
which is one step toward responding to a long-urged call for
legislative reforms.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the remarks as former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung and
his supporters ended a 240-hour relay fast in front of the
Legislative Yuan to press for the passage of the constitutional
amendment for legislative reforms by March 20 presidential election
day, to halve the number of legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that in Friday's floor meeting, the DPP will propose
that the draft constitutional amendment go to a second reading, with
a third reading to be passed at an extraordinary session March 18.
</P>
<P>
Tsai claimed that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) will only budge under pressure from the public
before the March 20 presidential election if they don't support the
DPP's proposal.
</P>
<P>
"We shall see if the KMT and PFP are really serious about
reforms, or they are only pretending in order to try to woo voters
before the presidential election," Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
On the KMT's remarks that it will not oppose sending the draft
amendment passed Wednesday to a second reading but will ask for
second and third readings of eight other constitutional amendment
proposals, including the abrogation of the National Assembly and an
adjustment of its duties, Tsai expressed hope that this is not just
an opposition facade to boycott the first reading of the
constitutional amendment passed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft amendment, the number of seats in the legislature
will be cut to 113, together with the adoption of "single seat, two
votes" system with one vote for individual candidate in a
constituency and another for a political party, and a lengthening of
the legislative term to four years from the current three.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, party whip of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union, an ally of the DPP, said that his party will propose that the
draft constitutional amendment to halve the number of legislative
seats be put to a second reading and that other constitutional
revision proposals be put on hold for the time being.
</P>
<P>
"If all nine constitutional amendment proposals have to be passed
together, the task will be too huge and will not be completed in this
legislature term and everything will start all over again in the next
Legislature," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party caucuses of the KMT and PFP noted that the
draft constitutional amendment proposal passed Wednesday is only one
of the nine proposals and they proposed that all nine go to a second
reading.
</P>
<P>
Liao Feng-teh, party whip of the KMT, said that all nine must be
passed and claimed that the "pan-green camp's" advocacy of passing
just one of them is "showboating."
</P>
<P>
He said that the KMT and the PFP think that a constitutional
amendment committee, which is in charge of the review of the
constitutional amendment proposals and other matters related to the
Constitution, should be suspended and that Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng should preside over consultations to decide all
proposals and then pass the second and third readings in
extraordinary sessions.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Chang-chieh, PFP legislative whip, also said that the
KMT-PFP camp, in response to calls from the public, hopes that all
constitutional amendment proposals "will be dealt with immediately."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of halving the number of legislative seats,
Legislative Yuan President Wang said a reasonable number should be
based on the "ecology and needs" of the legislature so that it will
run more smoothly and will be more representative of the will of the
people.
</P>
<P>
KMT Chairman Lien Chan said that he has always supported the
"halving of the legislature, " and the "single seat, two votes"
system, and that he is happy to see legislative reform.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the chances of the reforms passing before March
20 is slim, as there is not enough time.
</P>
<P>
PFP Chairman James Soong said that his party will be happy to see
a cut in the number of legislative seats, although he added that full
discussion on other complementary measures is also needed. He added
that if "one is constrained by pressure from populism and ideology,
then legislative goals will not be achieved."
</P>
<P>
"One should carefully consider how many seats are needed to allow
the legislature to function well," Soong said.

ROC SUPPORTS FORMATION OF PACIFIC UNION: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China supports the
proposal to form a European Union-style Pacific Union, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gary Song-huann Lin, director of the foreign ministry's East
Asian and Pacific affairs department, told a regular news conference
that both New Zealand and Australia have been advocating the
formation of a Pacific Union and that Australia has become
increasingly active in participating in South Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
If the proposed Pacific Union can truly be established, Lin said
it will contribute to regional stability and cooperation. The union
can also become a mechanism for solving disputes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has five diplomatic allies -- the Solomon
Islands, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Nauru and Tuvalu -- in the
South Pacific and has representative offices in two other countries
in the region -- Fiji and Papua New Guinea -- Lin said Taiwan has
traditionally played an important role in the region's development.
</P>
<P>
So if the Pacific Union is formed, Lin said, the ROC will apply
for membership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lin said the ROC's engagements with New Zealand and
Australia have increased significantly in recent years. Several
parliamentary groups from the two countries will travel to Taiwan in
the coming days to observe Taiwan's presidential election and its
first-ever referendum to be held simultaneously on March 20, Lin
said, adding that a delegation, headed by Craig Emerson, a member of
the Australian House of Representatives, will visit Taiwan March
14-20 to look into Taiwan democratic development.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a foreign wire service report that Bangladesh has
recalled its ambassador to Beijing, Lin said the foreign ministry is
still checking whether the recall is for routine home consultations
or whether the recall has anything to do with the opening of a Taiwan
representative office in that country.
</P>
<P>
"We have sent a message to the Bangladesh government asking about
the reasons behind the recall of its Beijing envoy. As Thursday is an
Islamic holiday in Bangladesh, we have yet to receive a response, "
Lin said, adding that the foreign ministry will closely watch for any
developments.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh maintains formal diplomatic ties with mainland China.
It reached an agreement with Taiwan earlier this year on the exchange
of representative offices. The ROC representative office in the
Bangladesh capital of Dhaka was inaugurated March 1. Lin said, the
representative office now operates normally and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Lin further said the ROC has shipped a batch of rice to the
Dominican Republic to help flood victims there. According to Lin, the
ROC's diplomatic ally in the Caribbean was hit by serious floods last
November, resulting in huge financial losses and a food shortage.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our rice donation will help relieve food shortages in
the Dominican Republic and further cement our bilateral
relationship," Lin said.

OPPOSITION CALLS FOR RESTRAINT IF ACCOSTED DURING MARCH 13 RALLIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance"
released a set of provisions Thursday for people taking part in an
islandwide demonstration against President Chen Shui-bian and his
administration to avoid clashes if participants at the rallies are
provoked.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan,
who is running for president, and his running mate, People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, has called for a number of rallies
for March 13, the last Saturday before the March 20 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Ma Ying-jeou, the mayor of Taipei and one of the top campaign
aides for the "pan-blue alliance" announced at a news conference the
set of guidelines, which were grouped in an apparent parody of the
"four noes plus one, " that the president included in his 2000
inaugural speech. These included not holding a referendum on the
nation's status quo concerning independence or unification with
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Ma explained that the "four noes" of the "pan-blue alliance"
refer to "no welcome for those who mudsling or otherwise call
participants at the rallies communists; no response to those who try
to provoke marchers; no clashes with those who try to frame the
participants, and no retort to abusive language." Ma asked that all
participants remain calm, rational and avoid any conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The final "no" is "no litter should be left behind after the
rallies, only the footsteps of the marchers," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all participants to follow the spirit of Gandhi by
expressing their dissatisfaction with the present government in a
"loving, peaceful and non-violent manner."
</P>
<P>
Ma said that the main theme of the March 13 rallies is a "vote
for change, " and he welcomed everyone who is unsatisfied with the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party to take part in a peaceful way,
but he hoped that no one would create a disturbance during the
rallies.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that anyone who is bullied or verbally abused should not
take matters into their own hands and instead let the police or those
tasked with maintaining order and security handle the situation. If,
for example, someone raises the national flag of the People's
Republic of China and shouts, "Hail to [Beijing President] Hu Jintao"
to try to frame the "pan-blue alliance" supporters, marchers should
not be angry or feel the need for retribution -- just flash the "V
for victory" sign, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that changing the president is the means to an end,
namely, "saving Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
In any democratic society, Ma continued, presidential elections
are a time for review of the performance of the president during his
term, and the incumbent should face the review by the people in a
humble way.
</P>
<P>
Both Ma and other top campaign officials, including Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, KMT official Ting Shou-chung and
spokesman Tsai Cheng-yuan donned red headbands emblazoned with the
word "change" at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Each of them also carried paper fans with the word "change, "
printed on them and wore pins saying, "got 20, " meaning that the
wearer will secure 20 other people to vote for the "pan-blue
alliance" candidates. They also flashed the "V" sign and repeatedly
shouted, "Change the president to save Taiwan, " in Mandarin,
Taiwanese and Hakkanese.
</P>
<P>
They urged all "pan-blue alliance" supporters to come out wearing
blue (the color of the KMT) or orange (that of the PFP) , and bring
plastic baton noise-makers, horns, trumpets, whistles, and even pots
and pans to bang together at the rallies.
</P>
<P>
Ma encouraged those who intend to participate in Saturday's
rallies to use alternate mean of transportation since traffic
controls will be in force. He even suggested people walk to the
venues if possible. Although no official pre-march figures are
available, Ma said he was confident that one million people would
show up to back the Lien-Soong ticket.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party mobilized
more than one million people to form a 500-kilometer, "hand-in-hand"
human chain along the length of Taiwan in a rally on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that starting from 1 p.m. Saturday, supporters will
converge on 145 staging points in 25 cities and counties. They will
then march to a designated place, for example, in Taipei to the
intersection of Ketagalan Boulevard and Park Road near the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Lien, Soong, Wang and Ma will take the stage at around 3:15 p.m.
to prepare to face the Presidential Office and shout, "Change the
president to save Taiwan" at 3:20 p.m.

NAVY TAKES DELIVERY OF EIGHTH PERRY-CLASS MISSILE FRIGATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ROC Navy took delivery of a new
Perry-class missile frigate from the Kaohsiung-based China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Annette Lu presided over the delivery ceremony
held at the CSBC's Kaohsiung shipyard in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In the ceremony, CSBC Chairman Hsu Chiang handed over a
scaled-down replica of the new frigate, christened the "Tien Tan,"
to ROC Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Miao Yung-ching to symbolize
the delivery. Naval officers then hoisted the ROC national flag on
the ship and decorated it with the ROC Navy's emblem to mark the
commissioning of the frigate into service.
</P>
<P>
The new warship is named after Tien Tan, a general during the
Warring States period (475-221 B.C.) in China who recovered his
fatherland from invaders.
</P>
<P>
The "Tien Tan" is the eighth and last Perry-class frigate that
the state-owned shipbuilding company had been commissioned to build
for the navy under a naval fleet modernization program launched in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the delivery ceremony, Lu said the smooth completion
of the Perry-class frigate construction program marks a remarkable
achievement in the pursuit of self-reliance and self-sufficiency in
national defense.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that the addition of the 'Tien Tan' frigate to
the naval fleet will beef up the navy's defense capabilities to
ensure stability and security in the Taiwan Strait," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
CSBC Chairman Hsu Chiang said the CSBC signed a contract with the
navy in August 2000 for the construction of the "Tien Tan" frigate
and that construction had proceeded smoothly since it began in
February 2001.
</P>
<P>
The 3,800-ton Perry-class frigate is armed with many
sophisticated weapons, including an advanced radar system, torpedoes,
rockets, deep-water bombs, and locally built "Hsiungfeng" II anti-ship
missiles. It can also be equipped with two anti-submarine
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Seven CSBS-built Perry-class frigates have long been commissioned
into service. With three-dimensional combat capabilities, the
Perry-class frigates have formed the backbone of the nation's
second-generation naval fleet.

EDUCATION MINISTER ADDRESSES SCHOOLING FOR TAIWAN CHILDREN IN CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will encourage
the opening of more schools for Taiwan businessmen's children in
mainland China, or having them study on Kinmen Island opposite Fujian
province, according to Minister of Education Huang Jong-tsun.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the remarks after having paid a visit to Kinmen
Wednesday, where he inspected the situation regarding mainland-based
Taiwan businessmen's children going to school there. Huang was
accompanied by ranking ministry officials and various lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
According to the education minister, his ministry is supportive
of the establishment of more schools for Taiwan businessmen's
children in mainland China. Otherwise they can consider receiving
education on Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Island, which lies closer to
the mainland's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Huang made the proposal given the fact that only about 10 percent
of Taiwan businessmen's school-age children based in the mainland's
southeastern coastal regions are able to enroll in local elementary
and junior schools set up especially for them.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen County Education Bureau Chief Lu Chih-hui made a briefing
on the occasion, reporting that a total of 42 children of Taiwan
businessmen from Xiamen, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou in Fujian province
are studying in Kinmen now -- 10 at elementary schools, 16 at junior
high schools and eight each at senior high schools and vocational
schools.
</P>
<P>
Lu said capacities at all levels of Kinmen's schools are more
than sufficient to accept more Taiwan businessmen's children from
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Kinmen County has in recent years earmarked more than NT$10
million (US$300,000) in building and refurbishing student residences,
Lu noted, adding that primary schools and junior high schools in
Kinmen can take at least 2,000 people and 1,000 people, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Lu stressed that Taiwan businessmen's children studying in Kinmen
will be given the same privilege as local students, ranging from free
insurance, books, transport and education fees to subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Cheng Jhen-long of the Taiwan Solidarity Union said only
1,500 out of about 15,000 Taiwanese children in the Dongguan and
Shanghai areas are accepted by the special schools for Taiwan
businessmen's children there, with the rest of them attending
international or local schools.
</P>
<P>
Cheng suggested that the government should pay greater heed to
assist Taiwan businessmen with operations in the mainland in opening
more schools for their children or encouraging Taiwanese children to
receive an education on Kinmen, a location which is particularly good
for those from the Fujian and Shanghai areas.

CABINET TO RESIGN AS ESTABLISHED PRACTICE AFTER ELECTION: YU
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 11 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday that he
and his Cabinet will respect the nation's established constitutional
procedures by presenting their resignations after the March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the comments in an interview on a political talk
show broadcast by a local television channel of the Eastern
Multimedia Group.
</P>
<P>
Although the March 20 election day is quickly approaching, Yu
said that he would only take leave to help in the campaign affairs of
his party's candidate after he has been able to take care of his
administrative work.
</P>
<P>
On the Cabinet resignation issue, Yu said that according to
established procedures, the premier and other members of the
Executive Yuan must present their resignations within a set period of
time after a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that he is a "team player, " Yu said that he will
respect his team's views, and that it is up to the team to decide his
political future after the election.
</P>
<P>
He said that he attaches great importance to the presidential
election and that he hasn't had any time to think about affairs after
election day.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether President Chen Shui-bian has promised to let him
continue serving in his post if he is re-elected for a second term,
Yu said he is not in a position to discuss the matter, adding that he
has to respect the president's authority and decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
On President Chen's recent comments that he might consider
selecting a woman to be premier if he is re-elected, Yu said the
comments represent the fact that the president attaches great
importance to women's participation in running the country.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that he agrees with the president's views on the issue,
but added that the president's comments by no means indicate that a
woman will be appointed premier after May 20, the inauguration day of
the newly-elected president.

Both contenders for the presidency are
scrambling their supporters to come out on the last weekend before
the vote on March 20 with rallies islandwide.
</P>
<P>
The Kuomintang and People First Party, which fielded a joint
ticket of Lien Chan and James Soong in the race, have called for
their supporters to take to the streets wherever they are on 3:20
p.m. Saturday and yell, "Go pan- blue, elect Lien-Soong" and "Change
the president to save Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
People who are not able to attend organized rallies have been
urged to blow their car horns, bang on kitchen utensils or make noise
however they can to show their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Lien will lead his followers in a march in downtown Taipei and
give a speech in the square in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Notable among Lien's followers in the march will be former
Premier Sun Yun-hsuan, although he has been confined to a wheelchair
since suffering a stroke, and well-known Taiwanese opera actress Sun
Chui-feng.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the march, several streets in Taipei City will be
closed to traffic on Saturday afternoon.

Soong will lead a similar march in Taichung City, while Lien's and
Soong's campaign manager, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will
preside over another march in Kaohsiung City.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Lien and Soong predicted that more than one
million supporters will take part in the rallies in all 25 counties
and cities around the island to show their dissatisfaction with the
administration of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
So many want to take part, the spokesman claimed, that organizers
in different places have hired almost all of the tour buses on the
island and have even enlisted help from truck drivers to help ferry
them to the 100-odd gathering places.
</P>
<P>
The islandwide rallies will receive heavy media coverage. The
Kuomintang-run China Television Company will cooperate with 11 TV
companies to provide live broadcasts of the activities. There will be
25 satellite news relay vehicles, four helicopters and more than 500
technicians and reporters covering the event from every corner of the
island, according to the spokesman.

Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has lined up
four huge campaign rallies for the final weekend before election day
for its presidential candidate, incumbent President Chen, with one in
its stronghold of Kaohsiung on Saturday, and another three in
Taichung, Ilan and Hualien on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kaohsiung rally will bring together Chen, his running mate,
Vice President Annette Lu, Chen's wife and former President Lee
Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
Each of them will give traditional campaign speeches and urge
their followers to flash a thumbs-up sign to show their support for
Chen and, who have been designated with the No. 1 for voting
purposes.

HONG KONG, MALAYSIA REACH AIR SERVICES DEAL

Hong  Kong,  March  12 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong signed an open-capacity
arrangement on air services with Malaysia Friday after two days of
negotiations in Kuala Lumpur, according to a government official.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary for Economic Development and Labour Wilson Fung
said the deal provides an open structure for both airlines to operate
as many passenger and cargo services between Hong Kong and anywhere
in Malaysia as they wish, without any limitation on routing, type of
service or aircraft.
</P>
<P>
It is the first of its kind signed by Hong Kong with an Asian
partner, Fung noted.
</P>
<P>
"The new open-capacity structure accords full flexibility for
airlines of the two sides to plan ahead and expand their services in
response to market demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With a view to expanding further our bilateral aviation
relationship, we have reached agreement with the Malaysian government
to enable the airlines of Malaysia to operate all cargo services
beyond Hong Kong to the United States," Fung explained.
</P>
<P>
"The new services will enhance competition in this long-haul
market. This is in the best interests of Hong Kong's shipping
community and reflects the government's determination to support the
development of Hong Kong's logistics industry. In return, airlines of
Hong Kong get very flexible and valuable fifth-freedom rights to
operate beyond Malaysia," Fung added.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged Hong Kong and Malaysian airlines to make use of the
liberal structure to introduce new services between the two places,
and beyond to other destinations.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian airlines have also been invited to use Hong Kong as
their hub for trans-Pacific all-cargo services.

TAIWAN-BASED BANKS POST LOWERED OVERDUE LOAN RATES FOR DECEMBER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan-based banks posted an average
overdue loan rate of 4.33 percent for December last year, a level
better than the target set by the Ministry of Finance, according to a
quarterly report issued Friday by Taiwan's Central Bank of China
(CBC).
</P>
<P>
The top five domestic banks with the lowest overdue loan rates
are Cathay United Bank (0.82 percent), East Sun Bank (1.18 percent),
First Commercial Bank (1.46 percent) , Taishin International Bank
(1.59 percent) and Chinatrust Commercial Bank (1.65 percent), the CBC
report shows.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, 12 banks, such as Chung Shing Bank and Medium
Business Bank of Kaohsiung District, still failed to surpass the
government-set level, the CBC report shows. Chung Shing Bank recorded
the highest level of 59.03 percent, followed by Medium Business Bank
of Hualien District with 23.99 percent, Pan Asia Bank with 22.63
percent and ChinFon Commercial Bank with 19.21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among them, seven major public banks posted a lowered average
overdue loan of 4.31 percent for February this year, an improvement
as compared to the January's average level of 4.35 percent, the
December's 4.37 percent and the November's 4.76 percent.
</P>
<P>
The drop is an indication that the seven major domestic banks --
Bank of Taiwan, Land Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, Chang
Hwa Bank, Hua Nan Bank, First Commercial Bank and Medium Business
Bank of Taiwan -- have improved their business in writing off bad
loans and in the control of releasing loans due to a better business

Taiwan expects to outpace South Korea in global market share in 2004,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Electric scooters were first introduced in Taiwan in 1998 and
roughly 23,000 of them have been sold, but because of high prices,
the cancellation of subsidized purchase plans, difficult maintenance
and being inconvenient to charge, sales have been slow.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers are now turning their attention to light electric
vehicles that have a cruising range of only about 30 kilometers on a
single charge, compared with 50 kilometers to 60 kilometers for
electric scooters. The official said that the current thinking is to
target potential users who would only drive the vehicles around town.
</P>
<P>
These vehicles retail for around NT$20,000 (US$600) and Taiwan
will produce 100,000 of them this year, an increase of 10,000 units
from the previous year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Although the global market for electric vehicles is at present
not very large, the official said that Taiwan should be able to carve
out a niche in the global market for them since it has a great deal
of experience in producing scooters and has much skill it its
mechanical industrial sector.

SEVERAL LAWMAKERS URGE PATIENCE IN CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hours after various political factions in
the legislature agreed to amend the ROC Constitution before the March
20 presidential election to reduce by half the number of legislators
in the Legislative Yuan, several opposition lawmakers said Friday
that they had second thoughts on acting with so little time for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang legislators Chen Shei-saint and Shyu
Jong-shyong, and People First Party Legislator Hsu Yuan-kuo
said at a news conference that they support the reform of the
legislature but worry that if it is done in haste, more problems will
be created than are solved.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that is unfortunate that the first time the Legislative
Yuan has the chance to initiate a constitutional amendment, it wants
to rush through the process. If the amendment is adopted without
first being carefully considered and evaluated, the legislature would
be even more irresponsible than the National Assembly which used to
be in charge of amending the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said the Constitution is the fundamental legal framework of
the country, and as such should be revised only after much thought
and deliberation rather than by rushing an amendment through the
legislature when the public is absorbed in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Shyu Jong-shyong, a four-term lawmaker, criticized the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers who have demanded that
the amendment be passed before the presidential election, saying that
they were simply "fooling around."
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling party is eager to make the legislative reform
a feather in its cap in the lead-up to the presidential election, and
thereby prevent many lawmakers from airing their different views. The
current problems with the legislature lie not in the number of its
seats, but in the quality of it members, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reducing the number of lawmakers and switching the election
system from multiple members from one district to one member per
constituency won't address the current problem, Shyu said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Hsu Yuan-kuo, who has a doctorate in jurisprudence, said
halving the legislature will only prompt chaos instead of preventing
it.
</P>
<P>
In a legislature with only 113 seats, as proposed by the ruling
party, each of the 12 standing committees will consist of no more
than 10 members and four of five members teaming together would be
enough to control the whole committee, which would not be in the best
interest of the country, Hsu Yuan-kuo said.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is seeking support from his colleagues to bring a
halt to the headlong rush to amend the Constitution and to leave the
issue until after the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chin-teh is the only ruling DPP member who
opposed an agreement entered by various political factions to act on
the proposal to reduce the number of seats before the presidential
election. He told a news conference that all proposals aimed at
revising the Constitution should be enacted together.

<P>
Around 15,000 Taiwan businessmen operating
in mainland China will return to Taiwan via the "mini three links" to
vote in the March 20 presidential election, the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Huang Chieh-cheng was citing figures provided
by a Taiwan businessman's association in the mainland port city of
Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The MAC announced last week that in response to demands by a
Taiwan businessmen's association in Fujian Province, the MAC had
agreed that Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland should be
allowed to return to Taiwan via the channel to vote in the election.
</P>
<P>
From March 11-30, businessmen operating on the mainland will be
able to travel via Kinmen and Matsu to and from Taiwan for the
election, just as they did earlier this year for Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
MAC officials said that the travel option is only open to Taiwan
businessmen, their employees and their dependents and does not apply
to other Taiwanese on the mainland.

CABINET DEFENDS CEC DECISION TO COUNT MISCAST BALLOTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said
Friday that the Central Election Commission's (CEC's) decision to
count miscast ballots in the March 20 presidential election and
referendum is legal and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Lin was responding to opposition criticism that the CEC's
decision to count ballots cast in the wrong boxes in the presidential
election and referendum is "illegal and absurd."
</P>
<P>
According to the Referendum Act, anybody who casts articles other
than referendum ballots into the boxes will be liable to a fine of
between NT$5,000 and NT$50,000.
</P>
<P>
The CEC announced Thursday that election administrators should
prevent voters from mistakenly casting presidential ballots into
referendum ballot boxes. If necessary, such voters should be brought
to justice and could be given a maximum two-year prison term in line
with the law.
</P>
<P>
The CEC also decided that presidential ballots that are miscast
into referendum ballot boxes due to the negligence of polling station
workers will still be counted as valid.
</P>
<P>
Lin hailed the CEC decision, saying the decision complies with
the democratic principle of respecting and protecting people's voting
rights.
</P>
<P>
"In a democratic system, we must respect opinions expressed by
citizens through ballots. Therefore, every ballot is precious and
sacred. We should not lightly invalidate a ballot simply because of
certain minor technical issues, such as a ballot being cast into the
wrong box," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) has questioned the legality and
constitutionality of the nation's first-ever referendum to be held
alongside the election.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the legality and constitutionality of President
Chen Shui-bian's decision to hold the referendum are undisputable,
Lin said it is very common in democratic countries around the world
for a referendum to be held simultaneously with a general election.
</P>
<P>
"Local voters are also no strangers to casting ballots for
different elections at the same time. In 1998, Taipei voters elected
the city mayor as well as city councilors and legislators of their
constituencies simultaneously at same polling stations.
</P>
<P>
At that time, ballots cast into the wrong boxes were counted as
valid, " Lin recalled, adding that he could not understand why
opposition politicians would question the CEC's decision on the
validity of miscast ballots.
</P>
<P>
However, the KMT and PFP legislative caucuses called a joint news
conference Friday evening urging the CEC to have second thoughts on
its decision.
</P>
<P>
The opposition caucuses said CEC commissioners should meet again
next Monday to review and "correct" its decision to avoid controversy
and speed up the vote-counting procedure on election day.
</P>
<P>
"Since the CEC acknowledges that the act of casting a
presidential ballot into a referendum box is illegal, how can a
miscast ballot be counted as valid? " PFP Legislator Feng Ting-kuo
asked.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Diane Lee said that if the CEC fails to correct
its contradictory decision, the "pan-blue alliance" will mobilize its
supporters to stage a protest in front of the CEC.
</P>
<P>
CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said Thursday that while it is
unlikely that ballots for the presidential election will be cast in
the boxes provided for the referendum ballots, or vise versa, any
such vote will still be counted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Huang said, the outcome of the presidential election
will have to be announced twice. The first announcement will be made
when all ballots in the boxes for presidential election are tallied
and the second will be made when the boxes for referendum ballots are
counted, in case any presidential votes are found to have been cast
in the referendum boxes.

NEW EVIDENCE FOUND OVER CAL JET CRASH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China Airlines (CAL) will be fined by the
government, as fresh evidence indicating that the carrier was to
blame for a crash off Penghu County in May 2002 has been found, a
spokesman for the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) under the Executive
Yuan reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications is planning to issue a fine of
NT$1.8 million (about US$54,000) to the carrier over the crash, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The ASC official, however, pointed out that while the new
evidence might not necessarily be the key cause of the crash of
flight CI611, it will make the investigation into the fatal accident
more comprehensive. The results of the ASC probe are slated to be
released late this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the ASC official, the new evidence was discovered
during a CAA investigation into CAL's maintenance and repair record
of the crashed Boeing 747-200 jet, which shows that the carrier had
failed to conduct a preventive anti-rust operation in a timely manner
every four years.
</P>
<P>
The evidence clearly shows that CAL carried out the operation
some 13 months past the date the work should have been carried out,
he explained, pointing out that the carrier should have done the work
in November 1997 but did not do so until December the following year.
</P>
<P>
CAA officials added that CAL has already been punished three
times since last year alone for failing to carry out its maintenance
and repair operations on schedule. It was penalized twice last year
with fines of NT$600,000 and NT$900,000, respectively, and was issued
a third fine of NT$3 million early this year.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the carrier's repeated failings, the CAA will
demand a detailed explanation of CAL's maintenance and repair work on
its airplanes, the CAA officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747-200 passenger plane crashed into the sea off
Penghu County May 25, 2002, en route for Hong Kong, killing all 225
people on board. An initial investigation showed that metal fatigue
might be the main cause of the accident, as the aircraft broke into
pieces in flight.

A formal announcement of the outcome of

<P>
CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng made the remarks when he fielded

DPP CAMPAIGN HEAD CONDEMNS LOCAL DAILY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the top campaign officials for the
re-election of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
condemned the United Daily News (UDN) Friday for what he described as
the newspaper's biased reports in the run-up to the March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the Presidential Office and
executive director of Chen's campaign headquarters, called for the
public to boycott the UDN, one of Taiwan's major dailies in
retaliation for the daily's "obvious partiality" for Chen's
challenger, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
Ridiculing the UDN's accounts of the first lady's "mammoth
trading" on the stock market as "utterly groundless, " Chiou asked:
"What are the morals of journalism and what are the standards for
news reporting?"
</P>
<P>
Chiou said he condemned the UDN because the daily has carried not
a single word about the overseas assets owned by Lien or how he has
raised funds via figurehead companies, while sparing no efforts to
give enormous publicity to Chen Wu Shu-chen's stock trading.
</P>
<P>
Chiou claimed that legislators Lee Wen-chung and Duan Yi-kang of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party have both collected detailed
and precise evidence proving that Lien owns huge amounts of overseas
assets and how he operates figurehead companies to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
Chiou also said that opposition People First Party Legislator
Chou Hsi-wei's account the other day that the first lady has traded
on the local bourse to the tune of NT$17 billion (US$512 million) is
a "sheer fabrication" and an insult to the wisdom of the Taiwan
people.
</P>
<P>
Describing the UDN as having degenerated into no more than an
opposition "pan-blue alliance " pamphlet, Chiou called for voters not
to spend a dollar on the purchase of the UDN, a major daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UDN management claimed later in the day that the
daily has treated all news concerning the first lady "impartially and
matter of factly."
</P>
<P>
The UDN management argued that every piece of news has its own
life and development cycle and that the editors must decide whether
to carry a story or not depending on how the news unfolds.

ROC EXPRESSES SYMPATHY OVER TERRORIST ATTACKS IN SPAIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Eugene Chien
expressed condolences Friday to the families of the people killed in
inhuman terrorist attacks in Madrid a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
"I have expressed deep condolences from the Republic of China
government and people to the Spanish government and people in this
terrible hour of tragedy, and in the face of unspeakable evil, that
has brought about the deaths of so many innocent people, " Chien said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he has directed the ROC representative office
in Madrid to convey his sympathy and condolences to his Spanish
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Chien said the ROC government and people love peace, respect
human rights and firmly oppose any form of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ten terrorist bombs exploded in three busy Madrid train stations
during the height of the Thursday morning rush hour, killing nearly
200 commuters and wounding more than 1,000 others in Spain's worst
terrorist attack ever.
</P>
<P>
Chien said he is very concerned about the safety of ROC
expatriates and travelers in Spain. "I have instructed our
representative office in Spain to strengthen protective measures and
offer all necessary security services for ROC expatriates and
tourists," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he went on, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked
domestic law enforcement authorities to step up security measures at
foreign embassies and representative offices in Taiwan and tighten
protection for their staff.
</P>
<P>
The rush-hour bombings struck three railway stations in the
Spanish capital, three days before the nation's elections. The
Spanish government initially blamed the Basque separatist group ETA,
but ETA-linked officials denied involvement. A statement e-mailed to
an Arabic newspaper later claimed that the international al-Qaida
terror network was responsible.
</P>
<P>
Messages of dismay and sympathy sent to the Spanish government
from capitals worldwide all condemned the attacks as a "ferocious,
senseless and barbaric" assault on Spanish democracy.

who are eligible to vote in Taiwan totals about 16,000, a
high-ranking Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chieh-cheng, a vice chairman of the Cabinet-level MAC, said
that of the 16,000-odd mainlanders, about 13,000 are spouses of
Taiwan citizens, while the remaining 3,000 are members of the
extended families of Taiwan citizens as a result of closer
people-to-people relations across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at a regular MAC press conference, Huang was
asked whether the mainlanders who are eligible to cast presidential
ballots in Taiwan March 20 are also eligible to cast referendum votes
on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Huang answered that if mainland citizens are eligible to vote in
the election, it means they all have already obtained their Republic
of China IDs. As ROC ID card holders, they are eligible to cast
referendum votes just like every ROC citizen in Taiwan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Huang declined to speculate on the turn-out rate of the
Taiwan-residing mainlanders in the presidential election and
referendum.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the MAC has paid close attention to
developments in the ongoing second session of the 10th National
People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Although many NPC deputies have expressed differing opinions on
the so-called "Taiwan issue" and related affairs, the MAC considers
Beijing's policy on Taiwan to be basically unchanged, although the
rhetoric has eased in general, Huang said.

LEGISLATIVE REFORM BILL TO GO INTO 2ND, 3RD READING MARCH 19
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan decided Friday after
consultations between the ruling and the opposition parties that a
draft constitutional revision bill concerning legislative reforms
will be put to second and third readings on the eve of the March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In response to calls from the public for a more efficient
legislature, a constitutional revision committee in the legislature
on Wednesday passed the first reading of the draft constitutional
revision bill on legislative reforms, one of nine constitutional
revision bills on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft constitutional revision bill, the number of
legislative seats will be cut to 113 seats from the current 225 in
2008 and the electoral system will be changed to a "single seat, two
votes" system, meaning that instead of the current multiple seat
system, there will be one vote for the individual candidate and one
vote for the party in each constituency. The legislative term will
also be lengthened to four years instead of three.
</P>
<P>
However, there are misgivings about whether a streamlined
legislature will ensure efficiency and there are also calls that the
legislature should hold public hearings to listen to views from all
quarters so as to make a comprehensive overhaul of the details
instead of rushing the bill through.
</P>
<P>
Still, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition
parties agreed in consultations Friday that the bill will go to a
second and third reading March 19 to project a pro-reform image
before the neck-and-neck presidential election,
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-lang, DPP legislative whip, hailed the long-awaited
completion of the bill and said it will "live up to the expectations
of the people" and will be a great stride toward legislative reforms,
which will be a victory for the people.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi also said that the "consultation
Friday was unexpectedly smooth and that the Legislative Yuan should
complete the final reading of the bill March 19."
</P>
<P>
Under the procedure for constitutional amendment, the legislature
will then ask the National Assembly, whose 300 members will be chosen
in proportion of the ratio of the various political parties, to
confirm the constitutional amendment bill in a specially convened
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung was elated to learn
that the bill is very likely to clear the legislature before the
election.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who led a group of his supporters in a relay fast in front
of the Legislative Yuan to highlight the cause of halving the number
of legislative seats, thanked the legislature for its decision.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the legislature "made a good decision" and he
expressed hope that the procedure in the Legislature can be completed
by next week, so that the public will feel that "there is hope for
reforms and that the nation can continue to progress" before March 20.

TAIWAN ELECTION PREVENTS QUICK E.U. REMOVAL OF ARMS EMBARGO ON CHINA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Paris,  March 11 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Commission of the European Union feels
that as Taiwan's presidential election is approaching, the E.U.
cannot make a formal decision in its upcoming summit meeting to
remove an arms sales embargo on mainland China, an influential French
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The European Council, the E.U.'s highest decision-making body
that groups the heads of state and governments of the fifteen E.U.
countries, is scheduled to hold a summit meeting March 25-26 to
discuss whether the E.U. should remove its embargo on arms sales to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Le Monde newspaper, Beijing has urged European
countries and the E.U. to lift the embargo in place since Beijing's
1989 massacre of pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said that the E.U. issued a code of conduct in
1998 to regulate its members' arms sales as well as high-tech
transfers to third countries, and that removing the embargo does not
mean that E.U. countries can easily export arms to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
However, there are no laws to stop such arms sales and those
E.U. countries that sell weapons to the mainland secretly cannot
be prevented from doing so, the newspaper cited French defense
experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the upcoming European Council summit will touch on the
embargo issue, the newspaper said that "the E.U.'s executive body
estimates it is impossible that a formal decision will be taken on
the occasion due to the proximity of the presidential election and
referendum scheduled to be held in Taiwan March 20."

KMT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PAYS TRIBUTE TO ROC FOUNDING FATHER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 12 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
paid tribute to the Republic of China's founding father, Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, Friday by laying flowers at the foot of Sun's statue at the
Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall to mark the 79th anniversary of his
passing.
</P>
<P>
Lien, the "pan-blue alliance's" presidential candidate, said that
at a time when the 2004 presidential election is only seven days
away, all ROC citizens should remember the ideals and teachings of
the nation's founding father as well as his contributions to the
nation and its people.
</P>
<P>
Lien called for all the people of the Republic of China to use
their ballots in the March 20 presidential election to choose a head
of state who is able and willing to champion Dr. Sun's pivotal
nation-founding ideals of democracy, freedom and equality.
</P>
<P>
The former ROC vice president was accompanied by KMT Vice
Chairman Wu Po-hsiung and Lin Cheng-chih, who was once the top
official in charge of cultural affairs during the era of KMT rule.
</P>
<P>
After more than five decades of ruling in Taiwan, the KMT,
founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, lost power in the 2000 presidential
election to the Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
March 12 is better known as Arbor Day. The ROC government
designated the day of Dr. Sun's passing as Arbor Day four years after
his death in 1925. Today, trees are planted each March 12 in
remembrance of Dr. Sun's encouragement of afforestation and his
contribution to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, President Chen Shui-bian led an official
delegation to the scenic left bank of Tamshui River in Pahli, Taipei
County to plant a sapling of the Formosa date palm to celebrate Arbor
Day.

PRESIDENT PLANTS FORMOSAN DATE PALM SAPLING TO MARK ARBOR DAY

Taipei, March 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian planted a sapling
of an indigenous palm tree on the scenic left bank of Tamshui River
in Pahli, Taipei County Friday to celebrate Arbor Day.
</P>
<P>
Chen was flanked by a group of pupils from Tahkan Elementary
School in Pahli while he planted the Formosan date palm. He told the
school children that the Formosan date palm is a tough species able
to endure harsh environmental conditions. He added that the tree is
much like the Taiwan people who he said have great tenacity in the
face of tough challenges.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the tree-planting ceremony organized by the Taiwan
Forestry Bureau to mark Arbor Day, Chen said the event was designed
not only to remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Republic of China's
national founding father, but also to remind the people of the
importance of preserving the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
To signify its determination to protect Taiwan's natural
environment and make Taiwan a "green" silicon island, Chen said, the
government has made improving water conservation and afforestation
part of the "Challenge 2008 National Development Plan."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Taipei County Magistrate Su Chen-chang,
whose "egg head" has been his trade mark, jokingly said to the school
children that as he is bald, he knows very well about cold and wind.
He said he wants the children to help conserve the environment so as
to prevent the planet "from becoming bald."
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Taiwan Forestry Bureau said the Formosan date
palm was chosen as the tree to be planted on this year's Arbor Day in
a bid to help beautify the coastline near Taipei County as coastal
areas are the most suitable places for planting the tree.
</P>
<P>
The Formosan date palm is one of the four "great wonders" in
Taiwan's botanical history as it has survived through thousands of
years of climatic harshness, including the last ice age, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Formosan date palm is not actually a species of date palm,
they said, pointing out that it is so called because its fruit, which
is blue when mature, tastes like date.
</P>
<P>
Similar tree-planting events were held in other cities and
counties around the country Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China government designated the day of Dr. Sun's
passing as Arbor Day four years after his death in 1925. Today, trees
are planted each March 12 in remembrance of Dr. Sun's encouragement
of afforestation and his contribution to the nation.
</P>
<P>
In 2003, the Cabinet designated the Feb. 4 to March 12 period as
"Arbor Month" for the first time. During the month, some 1.29 million
plants and seedlings were planted on 534 hectares of community
parkland and school campuses around the island.

TAIWAN MUST STICK TO SOVEREIGNTY TO FACE GLOBALIZATION

<P>
Taiwan must stick to its own indigenous
sovereignty in order to ride over the many challenges brought by
globalization, Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lu made the remarks while giving a speech at the 2004 joint
annual conference of the World Taiwanese Congress and the World
Federation of Taiwanese Associations being held in this southern
Taiwan port city from Saturday to Sunday. Nearly 800 representatives
from around the world attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the face of mainland China's relentless efforts to gain turf
by competing against the United States in the Pacific region, Lu
encouraged the people of Taiwan to uphold their belief in democratic
values and principles and never surrender to the threat from Beijing.
"Taiwan must walk its own way and participate more actively in the
international community," she insisted.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the fact that the people of Taiwan have succeeded in
terminating authoritarian rule, implementing democracy and pushing
for transfer of power, Lu said that the Taiwan people still need to
accomplish the two above-mentioned tasks -- safeguarding Taiwan's
sovereignty and embracing globalization by displaying its strength as
an oceanic country.
</P>
<P>
At a time when Taiwan is at a historical crossroads, the country
should open up bravely to the world and pursue greater globalization
as a democratic member in the international community, the vice
president said.

PLAN TO INSTALL LED TRAFFIC LIGHTS ALMOST COMPLETE: MOEA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to replace incandescent lamps with
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in certain traffic lights will be
completed in March, creating major energy savings, the Energy
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Once the plan has been fully implemented, 280,000 of the 646,000
incandescent lamps used in traffic lights around the country will
have been replaced, which will save 8,000 watts of electricity per
year and reduce dioxide emissions by 75,000 tons through the savings
on electricity, which is usually produced by burning coal.
</P>
<P>
The plan will bring the usage of LED's from 8 percent of the
country's traffic lights to 32 percent, creating major savings on
electricity charges for local governments, which are in charge of
maintaining traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
LEDs are safer and last longer than the incandescent lamps,
produce more stable light and cost less to maintain. The Energy
Council began the plan to replace some traffic lights in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
The remaining traffic lights will also be substituted with LEDs
in the future, Energy Council officials said.

PRESIDENT VOWS NO WAR, PROMISES TO BE CROSS-STRAIT PEACEMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian vowed Saturday to
be a peacemaker between Taiwan and mainland China and predicted that
there will be no war between the two sides if he succeeds in his
re-election bid on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Chen, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), made the statement during a televised forum
in which Chen and his sole rival -- opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan -- aired their policies in their second such encounter with
only a week to go before the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that a task force, to be led by Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh and various leaders from the business and
industrial communities with the aim of promoting cross-Taiwan Strait
peace, will immediately begin its mission to conduct negotiations
with the mainland based on the results of the March 20 referendum on
normalized ties and the prevention of military conflict.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Taiwan is willing to hold dialogue with the
mainland to dilute cross-strait tensions, Chen said that war will not
erupt if he is re-elected for a second term and gave his assurances
that "our children will not be sent to the battlefield."
</P>
<P>
Following the May 20 presidential inauguration, the government
will appoint an envoy to be stationed in Beijing to help create a set
of effective mechanisms to forge and manage a stable and peaceful
relationship between the two sides, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Taiwan's first referendum, to be held on the same day
as the presidential vote, Chen said the people of Taiwan are entitled
to say "no" to the missiles aimed by Beijing at Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the Taiwan people to cast their ballots in the
historic referendum as a means of displaying to the world -- and
especially the mainland and the United States -- their deep
aspiration and strong resolve for peace.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the mainland's military buildup, the Taiwan people
should make their voice heard all over the world, Chen went on.
</P>
<P>
"During the coming four years, we will stick to Taiwan's
sovereignty, dignity and security to turn the nation into an economic
hub of Asia and the entire world, which by no means forms a part of
the mainland economy, " Chen vowed, adding that "Taiwan's sovereignty
is undisputable" and that "the Taiwan people will not allow the
country to become just a special region of another country."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated his determination to wipe out corruption from
Taiwan politics and said categorically that only his re-election will
put an end to such moneyed politics.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture of conciliation and compromise to his political
rivals, Chen said that he is willing to invite Lien and his vice
presidential running mate -- People First Party Chairman James Soong
-- to serve as his political affairs advisors and added that he will
fully support local developments as in the past, regardless of the
political affiliation of local government chiefs.

ELECTION CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES HEATING UP ISLANDWIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan was embroiled in presidential
election campaign activities Saturday as the 2004 campaign entered
its last week and both contenders in the race went all-out to woo
voters.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
People First Party (PFP), which is fielding a joint ticket, organized
huge rallies in 25 counties and cities around the island to boost
support for their candidates -- KMT Chairman Lien Chan for the
presidency and PFP Chairman James Soong for the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, some 400,000 alliance followers gathered in different
places in the city and marched toward the square in front of the
Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
At 3:20 p.m., the crowd blew whistles, banged on kitchen utensils
and made noise however they could to show their dissatisfaction with
President Chen Shui-bian and yell in chorus "Go pan-blue, elect
Lien-Soong" and "Change the president to save Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The noise lasted for ten minutes, measured 82 decibels and was
greeted with four tickets for a combined fine of NT$33,000
(US$1,000) from local environmental officials who were monitoring the
noise throughout the rally.
</P>
<P>
Lien, who had just emerged from a televised presentation of his
campaign promises, gave a speech to the followers. He also lay down
to kiss the land to show his love for the country. Joining him on the
platform were former Premier Sun Yun-hsuan, well-known Taiwan opera
actress Sun Chui-feng and various others.
</P>
<P>
Although confined to a wheelchair after suffering a stroke, Sun
attended the rally the whole way and even stood up to speak to the
followers. In a faltering and unclear voice, he urged them to vote
for Lien.
</P>
<P>
In a humorous response to first lady Wu Shu-chen's jeer a few
days ago that the rallies would not attract more than "a few
kittens, " Lee Hsin, the deputy speaker of the Taipei city council,
appeared at the rally in a cat costume.
</P>
<P>
In a similar rally in Taichung, Soong vowed to struggle for this
country with his life. In order to show his love for the country, the
former Taiwan governor and his wife also lay down to kiss the ground
at the rally.
</P>
<P>
In Kaohsiung, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is
the campaign manager for Lien and Soong, led a similar rally that
brought together more than 500,000 supporters for Lien and Soong.
Many veterans in the rally were so emotional that they broke into
tears.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, many people brought their pet cats along on the
march, thanks again to the first lady's ridicule.
</P>
<P>
Even in Tainan County, which is the hometowm of President Chen
Shui-bian and a bastion of the DPP, some 150,000 people attended a
rally to show their support for Lien and Soong.
</P>
<P>
In Chiayi, some 65 fishing boats gathered off the coast of Putai
to blow horns and let off firecrackers while they yelled "Lien Soong
go, go" on their civil band radios at an at-sea rally.
</P>
<P>
In the remote island county of Penghu, some 10,000 followers of
Lien and Soong gathered at Makung to show their support, a record
high turnout, according to its organizers.
</P>
<P>
In Miaoli, some 30,000 people attended a rally, prompting Miaoli
County Magistrate Fu Hsueh-peng to say that "with 30,000 together,
even the kittens will scare away a tiger."
</P>
<P>
In the frontline county of Lienchiang (Matsu), some 1,000 people
attended a rally, another record high, according to its organizers.
</P>
<P>
One of Lien's campaign workers claimed that the rallies attracted
more than 3 million people altogether.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPP also organized campaign activities around the
island. Chen's campaign offices in different places simultaneously
staged a skit in which actors swept the ground with brooms as a
symbol of cleaning up the "black gold" -- referring to corrupt
business tycoons who used to be closely associated with the preceding
KMT administration.
</P>
<P>
However, in Kaohsiung City, a march organized by the DPP to
highlight the importance of voting in the March 20 referendum,
Pingtung County Magistrate Su Chia-chuan and Kaohsiung County
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing were warned by police for giving speeches
to marchers without having obtained prior approval.
</P>
<P>
Later, a campaign rally was lined up in Kaohsiung attended by
President Chen, his running mate, Vice President Annette Lu, his wife
and former President Lee Teng-hui, all of whom gave speeches. It drew
some 500,000 followers.

ANTI-SARS PRODUCT IN MASS PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A product that researchers claim is
effective in fighting severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has
been put into mass production, a Tamkang University professor
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Adam S.Y. Lee, head of the Department of Chemistry, said that at
present, a chemical compound that is 99 percent pure can be produced
in quantities of 10 kg per week that can be provided to manufacturers
who produce anti-SARS masks and protective garments.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the Ministry of Economic Affairs had originally
commissioned the National Taiwan University (NTU) to research the
anti-SARS product, which was jointly developed by the NTU and Tamkang
University last year and has been proved effective in fighting the
atypical pneumonia, which hit Taiwan hard between March and late June
last year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that NTU commissioned Tamkang University to mass produce
the compound and said related technology will be transferred to six
manufacturers, who will produce disinfecting spray, shampoo, hand
soap and other cleaning products.
</P>
<P>
The product can also be dissolved in water and sprayed onto
surgical masks and protective garments, he added.
</P>
<P>
The major component of the "NTU anti-SARS No.1" compound is
8-hydroxy octanoic acid, which kills the virus that causes SARS, Lee
said, adding that tests show that 45 seconds after spraying the
chemical compound, it will destroy the outer membrane of the virus,
leading to the death of the virus. The product is non-toxic to
humans if eaten inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that N-95 surgical mask, which is widely believed to be
effective against SARS, loses its effectiveness when wet, but the
"NTU anti-SARS No.1" will be even more effective when wet.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui will appeal
at a forum Sunday for Taiwanese to support the first-ever national
referendum in Taiwan March 20.
</P>
<P>
The forum titled "National Referendum: Taiwan Makes its Voice
Heard, " is being sponsored by the Taiwan Advocates, in which the
former president serves as chairman.
</P>
<P>
The participants will include 496 "elite" from all walks of life
who will voice opposition to "the 496 missiles deployed by mainland
China targeting Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lee and several scholars and experts will speak on the legality,
necessity and the urgency of the two questions to be put to the
referendum vote -- whether Taiwan's anti-missile capability should be
strengthened in the face of the missile threat from mainland China,
and whether Taiwan should talk with Beijing over establishing
a peace and stability framework of cross-strait interactions.
</P>
<P>
Amid the controversy about President Chen Shui-bian's plan to
hold the referendum in tandem with the presidential election, Taiwan
Advocates officials said the referendum will be the first time that
Taiwan people use their ballots to express the views and the will of
the people, which will be a milestone in Taiwan's history.
</P>
<P>
"All Taiwan people have the responsibility and obligation to come
forward to cast their votes irrespective of their ethnic group,
gender, age or party affiliation, especially while faced with the 496
missiles targeting Taiwan," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"All Taiwan people should use their right and obligation to make
their voices heard to China and the world," they added.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which will have its main venue in Taipei, will be
linked live with eight other places in Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung
County, Pingtung City, Tainan City, Chiayi City, Hsinchu City and
Taitung City via teleconference.

It is expected that through the hookup, the number of people
taking part in the forum will set a record for participants at a

made when the boxes intended for the presidential election have been
counted, but the final results will not be announced until the boxes
for referendum ballots have been tallied and ballots for the election
placed in those boxes picked out and added to the tally of the
election.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the two-step announcement will be troublesome because
the longer the wait before the final results are announced, the more
anxious the public will become, and it might even lead to riots if
the winner in the first announcement loses in the second
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Even the Executive Yuan, which insisted that any misplaced
ballots be counted backed down Friday after security officials
expressed concern that the longer the interval between the first
announcement and the second announcement, the more difficult it will
be to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said he will respect the CEC's decision.
</P>
<P>
The CEC is expected to meet again Monday to address the DPP
Legislative Caucus concerns.

one who cannot be influenced by a sudden appeal to his own personal
safety -- such a man may be considered a man of perspicuity. Indeed,
a man who can resist such an influence, or such an appeal, must
really be a superior man."

TAIWAN TO SEEK RESUMPTION OF FOWL EXPORTS THROUGH WTO MECHANISM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  March 13 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will use its power as a member of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) to call for counties that have
disallowed the import of fowl from Taiwan to rescind the ban, an
unnamed source said in Geneva Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have adopted measures to ban fowl imports from
Canada and the United States due to last December's outbreaks of
avian flu in these two countries. Taiwan also on the no-import list
despite the fact that Taiwan has only witnessed a few cases of
low-risk pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus infection among its fowl.
</P>
<P>
Health experts have said that according to standards of both the
WTO and the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) , Taiwan's fowl
exports should not be affected by outbreaks of H5N2 avian flu virus
in other countries, adding that banning the importation of Taiwan's
fowl is unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting scheduled to be held by Taiwan's permanent mission
to the WTO March 15, senior officials from Taiwan's health and
agriculture authorities are expected to brief delegates from nine WTO
members -- Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia -- on the efforts
that the island has made in its fight against bird flu and to seek
their support for removal of the ban on Taiwan's fowl exports.
</P>
<P>
The officials will also emphasize during the gathering that
Taiwan has always been transparent in its efforts of disease
prevention and honest in informing the WHO and OIE of its situations
regarding epidemics, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the WTO's Committee on Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures will hold a two-day meeting March 17-18, the
source said that by using the WTO multilateral mechanism, Taiwan will
take this opportunity to directly urge those countries that have
banned the island's fowl imports to remove the restriction.
</P>
<P>
An official from Taiwan's trade mission in Geneva said that the
government will do its utmost to protect Taiwan farmers and related
sectors although he does not know whether the March 15 meeting will
immediately help Taiwan resume its fowl exports or not.

PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO PUSH FOR NEW CONSTITUTION IF RE-ELECTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday
that if he is re-elected, he will push for a new constitution to
better substantiate the fact that Taiwan is a genuine democracy and
that the people are the real leaders of the country when it comes to
enacting the nation's fundamental laws.
</P>
<P>
Calling the existing Republic of China Constitution "ambiguous
both on national identification and governmental structure, " Chen
said it is absolutely imperative that a new constitution be enacted
for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He added that if he is re-elected, he will see to it that the new
constitution is affirmed by the people of Taiwan in another
referendum held in 2006, paving the way for the implementation of the
new constitution beginning in 2008.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks during his keynote speech to the joint
meeting of the World Taiwanese Congress (WTC) and the World
Federation of Taiwanese Associations (WFTA), which opened in Taiwan's
southern port city of Kaohsiung Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he is encouraged to see that Taiwan's first-ever
nationwide referendum will allow the people to voice their feelings
about mainland China's missile threat and whether to seek a framework
to build better cross-Taiwan Strait interactions to ensure peace.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's historic referendum, to be held on the March 20
presidential election day, is the best gift that he has given the
people of Taiwan this year, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Chen offered his heartfelt appreciation to the nearly 1,000 WTC
and WFTA representatives who have traveled from around the world to
Kaohsiung to take part in the annual meeting, and he thanked them for
their support of himself and his vice president, Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
In a teleconferenced WTC-WFTA meeting in 2002, Chen recalled, he
said that Taiwan and mainland China are "countries on either side of
the Taiwan Strait, " based on the fact that Taiwan is a sovereign
state and is not a part of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he advocated the "one side, one country" concept to
firmly express his opposition to Beijing's "one-China" policy and the
"one country, two systems" model that mainland China used to take
over Hong Kong and Macau several years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Any move that is aimed at changing Taiwan's status quo should be
first approved by the 23 million people of Taiwan via a referendum, "
Chen argued.
</P>
<P>
Chen told his audience that the government decided to push for
Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum after serious
considerations on its importance and necessity.
</P>
<P>
Defying Beijing's suppression, he said, the government is
determined in carrying out the referendum, adding that, "The harder
Beijing's pressure, the firmer is our determination."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that participation in a referendum is a basic human
right and a demonstration of populist values, adding that the
government is advocating the upcoming referendum in the belief that
the people are in charge and that the government should trust the
people.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 165 countries in the world have held 1,523
referendums to allow their people to express their feelings on major
issues, Chen asked why there has not been a single referendum yet in
Taiwan, a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Facing the PRC's mounting military threat, including 496
ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan and Beijing's refusal to renounce
the use of force to solve cross-strait disputes, Taiwan should have
the right to free itself from terror and voice its disdain of
mainland China's missiles and other forms of intimidation, Chen
stressed.
</P>
<P>
If he is re-elected, Chen went on, he will also be instrumental
in safeguarding Taiwan's economic sovereignty in the international
community and facilitate Taiwan's participation in global activities,
including membership in the World Health Organization.

OVERSEAS VOTES COULD BE CRUCIAL IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OUTCOME
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  14 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overseas Chinese eligible to vote in
Taiwan's March 20 presidential election could be crucial in tipping
the scale in favor of one candidate given the closeness of the race,
several politicians said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang, who is also
the secretary-general of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
campaign headquarters, the winner of the election could be decided by
as little as 3 percentage points and, therefore, votes from abroad
could be key.
</P>
<P>
Sun Kauo-hwa, an overseas Chinese-elected legislator from the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , also said that for overseas supporters
of both sides, the upcoming election could be seen as a battle to
defend the Republic of China or to establish a new nation of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics released by the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission show that 9,020 qualified persons, who are expected to
return from abroad, have registered to vote in the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
In the 2000 presidential election, only 2,800 eligible overseas
Chinese registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
Many leaders from both political camps - the "pan-blue alliance"
of Lien Chan of the KMT and James Soong of the People First Party,
and incumbent President Chen Shui-bian -- have visited overseas
Chinese and Taiwanese communities in various countries to encourage
those who are qualified to return to Taiwan to vote.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that nearly 20,000 overseas Chinese and Taiwanese will
eventually come back to support the "pan-blue alliance, " Sun said
that at least 10,000 of them will attend a rally March 17 at the Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Chang Shiow-jen claimed that about
50,000 overseas Chinese and Taiwanese will support President Chen and
Vice President Annette Lu in their quest for re-election. She added
that members of the World Taiwanese Association are expected to join
a two-day activity held in Kaohsiung March 13-14 to express their
support for the DPP candidates.
</P>
<P>
A DPP official responsible for overseas affairs estimated that at
least 25,000 supporters of President Chen from abroad will return to
vote.
</P>
<P>
Because of the diametrically opposed ideologies of the two
candidates, and given the possible differing consequences of either
winning, Sun said that it is likely that more people will return to
Taiwan to vote than in the past.

CROSS-STRAIT TIES BECOME FOCUS OF REFERENDUM DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cross-Taiwan Strait relations became the
focus of the final round of 10 referendum debates Sunday, which
pitted the nation's top mainland policy planner against a
sharp-tongued independent lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
In the 70-minute live TV debate on whether Taiwan should
negotiate a viable mechanism with Beijing for peaceful interaction,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said cross-strait
relations are dynamic and need a viable mechanism for long-term
engagements to forge trust and avoid misunderstanding and
misjudgment.
</P>
<P>
"What we want to negotiate is an agreement on the
establishment of a viable interactive mechanism to handle dynamic
cross-strait relations, not to negotiate an ultimate solution to our
political dispute," Tsai explained.
</P>
<P>
In her view, Tsai said, cross-strait issue is not an issue
regarding independence or unification. "It's an issue regarding the
definition of relationship between two sovereign entities," she
explained.
</P>
<P>
Under mainland China's pressure, Tsai said Taiwan has spent much
more time than other countries on enacting a referendum law. "Now
that we have a referendum act to allowing for the holding of our
first-ever nationwide referendum, we should treasure it."
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that a referendum result favoring dialogue would
bolster Taiwan's position in any talks with Beijing, since it would
show that the Taipei government is backed by the public.
</P>
<P>
"History has told us that the smaller party in negotiations needs
the support of all the people to turn things to their advantage,"
Tsai said. "With people's support, the Chinese Communists would have
no opportunity to force us to unify and our government will have more
confidence in negotiations," she added.
</P>
<P>
However, Legislator Sisy Chen, who is also a flamboyant TV
political talk-show host, argued against the unprecedented
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Sisy Chen claimed that President Chen Shui-bian broke the law when
he called for the referendum, to be held March 20 alongside the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
She argued that the president can only legally call such a
referendum when the island's sovereignty faces an imminent threat
from a foreign force. She said there is no immediate danger from
mainland China that makes Saturday's vote necessary.
</P>
<P>
Sisy Chen also disagreed with President Chen's view that the
referendum would help encourage Beijing to begin negotiations
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"If the two sides can just sip tea and chat, then they would
have held hundreds of rounds of talks already," said Sisy Chen, who
was once the spokeswoman for the president's Democratic
Progressive Party, but has become one of its sharpest critics.
</P>
<P>
She said that before talks can happen, Taiwan must find a way to
meet Beijing's demand that Taiwan accept its "one China" policy.
The president has refused to agree to this.
</P>
<P>
In her view, Sisy Chen said cross-strait issues are too
complicated to be resolved through a referendum. "Cross-strait
dispute will continue raging no matter whether we cast or not
cast our ballots in this referendum," she claimed, adding that
she hopes local voters will not take part in this referendum.
The referendum will ask voters two questions whether Taiwan needs
to beef up its anti-missile defenses if China refuses to remove
hundreds of missiles pointing at the island and whether Taiwan
should seek talks with Beijing to set up a "peace and stability
framework."
</P>
<P>
The Tsai-Chen debate was the final round of a series of 10
such events required by the newly passed Referendum Act.

MISCAST BALLOTS NOT TO BE COUNTED: CEC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After many twists and turns, the Central
Election Commission (CEC) finally decided Sunday that miscast ballots
in the March 20 presidential election and referendum will be
considered invalid.
</P>
<P>
CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng made the announcement after all
CEC commissioners discussed the validity issue for three hours at an
extraordinary session.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to a conclusion that presidential election ballots
cast into the boxes provided for the referendum will not be counted
and vice versa," Huang said, adding that the decision was made in
line with the "expectations of major domestic political parties and
mainstream public opinion."
</P>
<P>
Huang's announcement marked the CEC's yet another policy
about-face in handling the upcoming presidential election and
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Just last Thursday, Huang said miscast election and referendum
ballots should be counted as valid. As a result, he said, the outcome
of the presidential election would have to be announced twice. The
first announcement would be made when all ballots in the boxes for
presidential election were tallied and the second would be made when
the boxes for referendum ballots were counted, in case any
presidential votes were found to have been cast in the referendum
boxes.
</P>
<P>
The decision came under fire from the opposition camp on the
ground that since the act of mistakenly casting presidential election
ballots into the referendum ballot boxes is illegal, such miscast
ballots should not be regarded as valid.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure, the CEC called a provisional meeting
Sunday to review its previous decision. After a heated debate
among CEC commissioners, the CEC finally decided to invalidate all
miscast ballots to avoid any controversy.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said the Cabinet respects the
CEC's final decision and hopes that the commission will not to make
any change again.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the CEC has made a decision, all election
administrators will abide by all CEC rules to ensure a smooth
proceeding of the presidential election and our first-ever
nationwide referendum," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the opposition camp to give the CEC more freedom in
handling election- and referendum-related administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
Besides ridiculing the upcoming referendum as "illegal and
absurd," the opposition camp has also claimed that the CEC might
rig the election results or that the outcome might cause a
post-election rioting.
</P>
<P>
"Such ill-motivated allegations have undermined election
workers' morale and reputation. We hope opponents can stop their
boycott against the referendum now that the CEC has responded to
their opinion regarding vote counting," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislative caucuses of all major political parties
hailed the CEC's latest decision, saying that the new decision will
help speed up vote counting on the election day.

REFERENDUM DEBATE PITS LAWMAKER AGAINST MEDIA PERSONALITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final round of debates on the upcoming
referendum on whether Taiwan should beef up its anti-missile muscle
in the face of Beijing's intensified military threat was held Sunday,
with a ruling party lawmaker facing off against a prominent media
figure.
</P>
<P>
In the 70-minute televised debate, Legislator Kuo Cheng-liang of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) defended President Chen
Shui-bian's decision to hold Taiwan's first-ever nationwide
referendum alongside the March 20 presidential election, while UFO
Network Broadcasting Co. Chairman Jaw Shau-kong questioned the
legality and constitutionality of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Kuo said mainland China began to deploy missiles against Taiwan
back in 1995, long before Taiwan's first-ever transition of power
between different political parties in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, Kuo said Beijing has become ever-more inflexible in
its attitude toward Taiwan. "In the past, Beijing said it would
attack Taiwan if the island declared independence. But now, it has
changed its stance, saying that if Taiwan indefinitely drags its feet
on unification, it would use force to have Taiwan come to terms."
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, Kuo said, the United States has come up
with a report warning that if Taiwan fails to upgrade its missile
defense system, the military balance in the Taiwan Strait will tilt
in favor of mainland China by 2006.
</P>
<P>
"Should that be the case, mainland China would force Taiwan to
negotiate unification under its terms. In the face of this situation,
we cannot sit idle," Kuo argued.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that President Chen's decision to hold Taiwan's
first-ever nationwide referendum will allow local people to show the
world their aversion to mainland China's missile threat and their
determination to safeguard national security, Kuo said if the
referendum fails due to a boycott from the opposition camp, it would
mark a severe blow to the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Kuo said, the international community
doesn't care about the opposition camp's questioning of the legality
and necessity of the upcoming referendum.
</P>
<P>
"What the world society cares about is the results of the
referendum, " Kuo said, adding that if the referendum fails, it will
deal a serious blow to Taiwan's international image and affect
relations with the United States and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"If the 'strengthening missile defense' question is voted down,
the international community will look down upon us, the United States
will question our commitment to defend our own national security, and
mainland China will become even more hawkish toward us," Kuo claimed.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the referendum will help local people better
understand the importance of reinforcing Taiwan's defense
capabilities, Kuo urged local voters to cast ballots in the
referendum to have their voice heard in the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, Jaw, a former lawmaker who also once served as
environmental chief, said the upcoming referendum was a joke and a
ploy to boost President Chen's re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
Jaw said the opposition camp has never opposed procurement of
anti-missile batteries. "Such an issue doesn't need a referendum. We
should respect professionalism in dealing with defense issues.
Whether we should buy more anti-missile batteries should be left to
the Ministry of National Defense to decide."
</P>
<P>
He further said holding a referendum alone can never help
strengthen Taiwan's national defense. "The most important thing at
the moment is to revitalize our economy. If we enjoy an economic
boom, we'll have more budget to renovate our arsenal. Our defense
budget has declined steadily in the past few years mainly
because of the DPP administration's inexperience and
incompetence in managing our economy," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Jaw also blamed the DPP administration for its pro-independence
stance, claiming that the DPP administration's emphasis on Taiwan's
national identity has strained relations with mainland China and
confused the nation's military service members. "Our troops have
become very confused about our nation's cause," he argued.
</P>
<P>
Before ending his debate, Jaw urged voters to boycott what he
called the "illegal" March 20 referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan's Referendum Act, a nationwide referendum
will be considered valid only if more than half of eligible voters
vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Estimates indicate that at least 8.2 million voters must turn out
to vote to make the upcoming referendum valid. Observers say the
target will be difficult given that the opposition parties have
traditionally enjoyed an edge in Taiwan's divided political map.

LAWMAKERS FROM RIVAL CAMPS SAY MISCAST BALLOTS SHOULD BE INVALID
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several legislators from both the ruling
"pan-green" camp and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" expressed the
hope Sunday that presidential ballots cast in boxes designated for
referendum votes will be considered invalid.
</P>
<P>
More legislators joined a chorus Sunday urging the Central
Election Commission (CEC) to make its final decision on miscast votes
as quickly as possible given that the presidential election and that
of the referendum is less than a week way. The two votes will be held
Saturday, March 20.
</P>
<P>
The CEC's most recent ruling was to allow presidential ballots
cast incorrectly in referendum ballot boxes to be counted as valid,
although technically, according to the Referendum Law, anything put
into referendum ballot boxes except authorized ballots for the
referendum should be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said Saturday that the
CEC seems to be contradicting itself by considering miscasting
illegal, yet in the same breath counting the misplaced ballots as
valid.
</P>
<P>
The CEC decided Thursday to announce the outcome of the
presidential election in two steps. The first announcement will be
made when the boxes intended for the presidential election have been
counted, but the final results will not be announced until stray
ballots that were erroneously put in referendum boxes have been added
to the total.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the two-step announcement could spell trouble since the
longer the public has to wait for the final results, the more anxious
they will become. This, he said, could even lead to rioting if the
winner in the first announcement turns out to be the loser in the
second announcement.
</P>
<P>
Even the Executive Yuan, which insisted that any misplaced
ballots be counted, backed down Friday after security officials
expressed concerns that the interval between the first announcement
and the second announcement, could have an adverse effect on civil
order.
</P>
<P>
In view of the twists and turns over the past several days on the
issue of miscast votes, opposition People First Party (PFP)
Legislator Hsu Yuan-kuo, a PFP deputy whip at the Legislative Yuan,
said the CEC decision to considering miscasting illegal but counting
these misplaced ballots as valid is illogical and self-contradictory.
</P>
<P>
Such a decision benefits nothing and nobody except causing
greater suspicion for voters, Hsu added.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Cho Po-yuan said that according
to the Referendum Law, anything aside referendum ballots that are put
into the referendum ballot boxes is illegal and the voter could be
fined. It is ridiculous that illegal ballots could be counted as
valid votes, Cho added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislator Chiang Chao-yi from the ruling DPP advised
his party Sunday to respect the CEC's new decision if it changes its
previous decision and announces finally that miscast ballots are
invalid.
</P>
<P>
Chiang said that considering miscast ballots invalid will not
only contribute to reducing the opposition camp's bombardment, it
will also contribute to lowering the risks that might occur in
postponed announcements of the outcome of the presidential election
and referendum questions.
</P>
<P>
Wu Nai-jen, the campaign manager for President Chen Shui-bian,
said what ever the CEC decision is, it should be releases quickly to
"prevent the elections from being undermined by trivial technical
problems."
</P>
<P>
Wu blamed the opposition "pan-blue alliance" for constantly
interfering with electoral affairs, thus making it difficult for the
CEC to make wise and clear decisions.
</P>
<P>
The CEC met again Sunday to address concerns surrounding the
miscast ballot issue. It is expected to make an announcement later in
the day.

RECONCILIATION WILL ENABLE GREAT DEVELOPMENT FOR TAIWAN: SOONG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Reconciliation" will be the keynote of
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" in its final campaign efforts to
win the 2004 presidential election, which is six days away, the
alliace's vice presidential candidate said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
James Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party and
running mate of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, said
the "pan-blue alliance" will borrow the essence of "reconciliation"
as a tool to push for "great development" and "great reforms" in
Taiwan if the Lien-Soong ticket is elected.
</P>
<P>
It is the ultimate belief of the "pan-blue alliance" that only
striving to revive the domestic economy and seeking cross-Taiwan
Strait peace will the people of Taiwan be benefited, Soong said.
</P>
<P>
"If the economy continues to be bogged down, Taiwan will have no
future, and if there is no peace in the Taiwan Strait, the island's
economy will be doomed," Soong added.
</P>
<P>
Soong said he and Lien were touched by the overwhelming support
shown to them by alliance supporters around the country Saturday by
joining huge rallies in 25 counties and cities to support the notion
of "changing the president to save Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Soong said he still believes that President Chen Shui-bian had a
golden opportunity to lead the country to a much better situation
after he was newly inaugurated as president back in 2000, when many
supported the president's promise to institute reforms.
</P>
<P>
To the people's chagrin, Soong said, President Chen has
disappointed the voters first by failing to deliver on his reform
promises and flex the government's administrative muscle over the
past several years, and then by causing nationwide confusion by
pushing for a referendum alongside the presidential election and
failing to give satisfactory explanations to doubts about the
abilities of some of Chen's administration officials and the first
lady's alleged massive trading in the stock market in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Chen's failure in various areas over the past four years has
become an edge for the Lien-Soong ticket, Soong said, adding that
huge numbers of alliance supporters who covet political stability for
Taiwan and peace across the Taiwan Strait will turn out to vote for
Lien and Soong giving them an overwhelming victory.

PRESIDENT CHEN SAYS REFERENDUM SUCCESS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RE-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday
the success of Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum to be held
alongside the March 20 presidential election is far more meaningful
than his re-election.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a campaign rally in the southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung, President Chen said the world is watching the results of
Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum.
</P>
<P>
"We should use the referendum ballots to show the world our
determination to safeguard our homeland with peace and our commitment
to creating permanent peace with mainland China," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the March 20 referendum, voters will be asked two questions --
whether Taiwan should buy more anti-missile batteries if mainland
China refuses to remove the hundreds of missiles it has targeted at
the island and whether Taiwan should negotiate with Beijing for the
establishment of a viable mechanism for bilateral interactions.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party has questioned the legality and
constitutionality of the upcoming referendum and is urging its
supporters to boycott the referendum.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the opposition boycott campaign, Chen urged voters
to support the referendum to show their true love for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"Let's write history for Taiwan with the referendum. Let's use
the referendum ballots to show the world that democracy is more
powerful than missiles and dictatorship," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiwan's Referendum Act, a nationwide referendum
will be considered valid only if more than half of eligible voters
vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Estimates indicate that at least 8.2 million voters must turn out
to vote to make the upcoming referendum valid. Observers say the

TAIWAN-JAPAN COOPERATION SHOULD BE INCREASED UNDER WTO FRAMEWORK

<P>
Bilateral trade and economic cooperation
between Taiwan and Japan should be increased under the framework of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) , a government official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on Taiwan-Japan economic cooperation and
trade, Shen Chien-i, director of multilateral trade affairs under the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) , said that the WTO offers a platform
for normal economic exchanges between Taiwan and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should increase official exchanges in the
economic field under the WTO framework to offset the losses caused by
the absence of diplomatic ties between them, Shen suggested.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Taiwan's second-largest trade partner and its largest
source of imports, while Taiwan is Japan's fourth-largest trade
partner, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he went on, the two countries lack channels for official
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's economic and trade environment is more friendly and
transparent after it admitted to the WTO in 2002, Shen said, adding
that it is time for Japan's trade sector to capitalize on this.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was co-sponsored Monday by the BOFT under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Taipei office of Japan's
Interchange Association and the Association of East Asian Relations,

NUMBER OF STUDENT SUBSIDIES FOR OVERSEAS STUDIES TO BE INCREASED

<P>
The government will increase the number of
subsidies for students and researchers pursuing advanced studies
overseas from the current 235 to 1,000 per year by 2008, Cabinet
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to a resolution adopted by the board for recruitment
and cultivation of talented technological individuals under the
Executive Yuan, the officials said, the number of student subsidies
for study abroad toward a doctorate will be increased from 85 to 610
a year by 2008, while the number of doctoral research subsidies for
research abroad will be increased from 120 to 310 per year and the
number of subsidies for post-doctorate research abroad will be
increased from 30 to 80.
</P>
<P>
The number of Taiwan students enrolled in prestigious
universities in the United States for advanced studies has decreased
in the last 10 years in contrast with increasing numbers of students
studying in the U.S. from mainland China, South Korea, India and
Singapore, they noted.
</P>
<P>
If this trend continues, the officials added, Taiwan's
competitiveness in technological development will be weakened in the
long-run.
</P>
<P>
The government will offer more incentives to attract students to
pursue advanced studies abroad, including increases in government
subsidies, as a means of cultivating talent, they went on.

Under the new program, they said, the government will put an
additional NT$450 million (US$13.4 million) per year in the budget

TAIWAN HIGH-SPEED RAIL CORP. STUDYING ARBITRATION AWARD

<P>
The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC)
is mulling whether to accept an arbitration award wherein it was
ordered to pay US$73.04 million in damages to its former partner,
Eurotrain, a THSRC spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
THSRC spokesmen Lin Tien-sung said, however, that the worst is
over and he assured shareholders that the award will not disturb the
construction of the railway, which is scheduled to open for business
Oct. 31 next year.

THSRC teamed up with the Eurotrain consortium in 1996 to vie for
the right to construct the island's first high-speed railway but
ditched Eurotrain for Japan's Shinkansen consortium in 1999 after it
won the US$16 billion contract in 1997, on the grounds that Eurotrain
charged too high a price for its system and refused to become a
partner of THSRC.

EXPERT SEES FUTURE IN ASIAN-EUROPEAN BIOTECHNOLOGY COOPERATION
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two-way cooperation between Asian and
European biotech companies will create a mutually beneficial
relationship for both sides, Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) President Johnsee Lee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who also serves as chairman of the Taiwan Bio Industry
Organization, made the forecast at a seminar in which he gave a
keynote speech on the advantages of Asia's biotechnological
development and introduced investment and business opportunities and
strategies in the domestic industry to scores of foreign specialists
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The ITRI chief had just returned to Taiwan from Europe, where he
was invited to take part in the 2004 annual meeting of the BioSquare
held in Basel, Switzerland from March 10-12 in which more than 1,500
representatives participated.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the performance of the European biotech industry as the
most eye-catching in the world, Lee revealed that the ITRI -- one of
Taiwan's leading research organizations -- is promoting cooperation
with research institutes based in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's participation in this year's BioSquare annual conference
-- a unique platform where the managers of biotechnology companies
can meet with key research and business development executives from
the pharmaceutical, nutritional, agricultural, food and finance
industries -- has allowed European businesses to gain an
understanding of Taiwan's industry, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 1,100 biotech companies in Europe,
most of which are promising small- and medium-sized businesses, Lee
said, adding that the formation of joint ventures between companies
on the two sides will help forge a "win-win" situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, European biotech companies are particularly
interested in creating cooperative ventures with Taiwan-based firms
specializing in food, agriculture and Chinese herbs.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the production value of the global
biotechnology grew by 46 percent in 2003 from the previous year's
level, Lee predicted that business prospects for two-way partnership
between Taiwanese and European companies are bright, as both sides
have the potential and enjoy a strong competitive edge to develop the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he also met with TNO President Hans de Wit during his
trip to Europe for discussions on studies related to Chinese herbs
and opto-electronic displays. He added that de Wit showed a keen
interest in setting up a long-term partnership with the ITRI and to
travel to Taiwan to take part in a series of activities to be
launched by the organizers of a "Taiwan Biotech Month" planned for
July.
</P>
<P>
TNO is one of the top and largest research and technology
organizations in Europe, whose prime mission is to apply scientific
knowledge to businesses and government to strengthen their innovative
capacity.

</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when he answered questions from
the audience during a television program braodcast live from Yunlin,
central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that judging from past experience, the opposition will
react to his victory just as they did in the 2000 presidential
election. He was referring to protestors who surrounded the
headquarters of the Kuomintang (KMT) to demand that former President
Lee Teng-hui, who at the time doubled as KMT chairman, step down on
the night of the election.
</P>
<P>
This year, similar incidents could take place, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to realize that the election is a "one-time
event, " while Taiwan is forever. Democracy, he said, did not come
easily to Taiwan and everyone should accept the result of the
election.
</P>
<P>
He also warned voters to remain calm March 20, saying that anyone
creating a disturbance will be dealt with according to the law.

NSB BRIEFS PRESIDENTIAL CHALLENGER ON SECURITY AFFAIRS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 15 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Security Bureau (NSB), the
nation's top intelligence agency, briefed the opposition "pan-blue
alliance's" presidential and vice presidential candidates Monday on
Taiwan's current national security situation.
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan -- the sole challenger to
President Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid -- and his running mate
People First Party Chairman James Soong arrived at the NSB early in
the morning in the company of their chief campaign manager
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and several lawmakers from
their parties.
</P>
<P>
NSB Deputy Director Huang Lei told a news conference held after
the closed-door national security briefing that all presidential
and vice presidential candidates should support three principles --
the content of the briefing should be kept secret; the briefing
should not be used for political purposes; and refraining from
entangling intelligence units into electioneering.
</P>
<P>
Huang also assured the nation that the NSB will uphold its
cardinal work ethics of political neutrality and impartiality.
</P>
<P>
"None of the NSB staff will meddle with or get involved or
participate in any campaign activities. Throughout the election
process, the NSB will adhere to its underlying working principles and
make all-out efforts to safeguard national security," Huang stressed.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Lien told reporters before attending the special
election briefing that he opposed President Chen's insistence on
holding the presidential vote on the same day as Taiwan's first
islandwide referendum. The referendum deals with defense policy and
relations with Taiwan's biggest security threat -- mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"This is unprecedented. No matter how you do it, this whole
election process will be more complicated. Will this cause social
instability or election disputes? We don't dare to speculate," Lien
said.
</P>
<P>
He added what he most wants to know during the NSB security
briefing is whether the government has prepared comprehensive measures
to cope with possible uncertainties or contingencies on the election
day.

DPP URGES SUPPORTERS NOT TO HARASS CONTROVERSIAL BUDDHIST TEMPLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged party members and supporters
Monday not to harass a controversial Buddhist temple in Nantou
County's Puli township in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-lang, the DPP's legislative whip, made the appeal
after the Chung Tai Temple announced its decision earlier in the day
to close its doors to the public for a month as its leader's
endorsement of the opposition presidential candidate and his stance
against Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum to be held
alongside the March 20 presidential poll has sparked protests.
</P>
<P>
Scores of supporters of President Chen Shui-bian gathered at
Chung Tai on Sunday to protest Master Wei Chueh's endorsement last
Thursday of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan in the
upcoming election and his encouragement to his followers to refuse to
cast ballots in the referendum. Wei Chueh is one of Taiwan's top Zen
masters and has hundreds of thousands of followers.
</P>
<P>
Tsai urged DPP supporters to respect Wei Chueh's freedom of
speech and to stage no further protests at the temple.
</P>
<P>
"We should regard Wei Chueh's expression of his opinions as part
of his freedom of speech," Tsai said. "We respect his decision. We do
not want to see our supporters demonstrate against the temple any
more, as such actions only hurt the DPP's image."
</P>
<P>
The Zen master's endorsement of the opposition presidential
challenger and his anti-referendum stance has sparked a heated debate
about whether religion should be mixed with politics. A popular
Buddhist nun -- Dharma Master Shih Chao Huei -- criticized Wei Chueh
for getting involved in the election and accused him of failing to
abide by the law in reporting the temple's financial status.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism is Taiwan's most popular religion, with more than 9,860
clergy and 5.48 million followers, according to government
statistics.

<TEXT>
<P>
The government is looking into reports
that mainland China has asked Bangladesh to close Taiwan's
representative office in Dhaka, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene
Chien said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chien was responding to a wire report that said the mainland has
asked Bangladesh to take "effective" steps to shut down the Taiwan
liaison office in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Chien noted that Taiwan's substantive relations with Bangladesh
have grown rapidly, especially since Bangladesh is trying to become
"the factory for the world" and he said the ministry is trying to
encourage more Taiwan businessmen to invest in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Turning to an AFP report last week that Bangladesh recalled its
Beijing ambassador because Taiwan set up a representative office in
Dhaka, Chien said that the report is erroneous.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bangladesh government, the ambassador returned
to Dhaka for personal reasons and was not recalled by the
government, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taipei representative office in Dhaka has in
fact expanded its functions since its opening this month and has
begun to have contacts with the Bangladesh government and its people.

(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to tackle the large number of
Taiwan businessmen wishing to return from mainland China to vote in
the March 20 presidential election, airlines flying between Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macau have decided to add flights to meet the demand,
spokesmen for the various aviation companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
With only five days left before polling day, various airlines
have made the decision to cope with the extra passengers, they said.
</P>
<P>
China Airlines (CAL) will add three flights on its Hong
Kong-Taipei route March 19, while EVA Airways Corp. will add four and
five flights to its Hong Kong-Taipei and Macau-Taipei flights,
respectively, on the same day. CAL and EVA Airways are Taiwan's two
largest carriers.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Taipei-based Trans Asia Airways has decided to
resume its previous level of five flights per day on its Taipei-Macau
route, up from the present three-flights-daily service in the run-up
to the election.
</P>
<P>
UNI Airways. Corp. -- an affiliate of EVA Airways that offers 14
flights per day from the offshore island of Kinmen to Taipei,
Taichung, Tainan, Chiayi and Kaohsiung -- announced that flights will
be added on these routes to help Taiwan businessmen return via the
"mini links" -- direct transport and trade services maintained
between the Kinmen and Matsu islands and the ports of Xiamen and
Fuzhou in mainland China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based Dragon Airlines will add one flight to
its regular daily flight service between Hong Kong and Taipei on
March 17, 18 and 19.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that up to 120,000 Taiwan businessmen
operating on the mainland will return to Taiwan to cast their ballots

<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan conscripts serving alternative
military service overseas are performing well and have helped win
great respect and recognition in the international community,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chien made the remarks during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry
with 15 conscripts who recently returned home after having completed
their alternative military service of more than one year abroad
serving mainly as assistants to Taiwan's agricultural, technical and
medical care missions dispatched by the Republic of China government
to friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition to exchanging opinions and viewpoints on working
overseas, Chien also thanked them for their hard work and efforts in
their host countries and lauded their outstanding performances for
having gained a thumbs-up from local people, governments and ROC
outposts there.
</P>
<P>
"This encouraging result will push more young Taiwan men with
tertiary education to join the alternative military service program,
which in turn will win more international friendship and recognition
for the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hen-tai, an alternative military conscript who served as an
aide in a medical mission based in Malawi, said that he learned about
very different lifestyles and values while performing his service in
a foreign country. "That will be a very valuable and treasured
experience in our lives because we have learned tolerance and love, "
he added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan started to promote the alternative service program in
2001, and a total of 112 conscripts have been sent to serve in more
than 20 countries in Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean
and the Asia-Pacific region.

jobless? "; "Do you think measures the government has undertaken to
address the problem have worked? "; "Which presidential candidate is
better attuned to the needs of the unemployed? "; and "Do you think
governmental officials' salaries should be adjusted in proportion to
the people's pain index of living?"

INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON ISLAM OPENS IN TAIPEI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local Muslims have contributed to Taiwan's
cultural diversity, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of an international seminar on Islam,
Chien said Muslims have enjoyed exactly the same rights and
obligations as other Taiwan citizens and that many outstanding Muslim
nationals have contributed to Taiwan's development in various fields
over the years.
</P>
<P>
"Muslims have been an integral part of Taiwan's diverse culture,"
Chien said, adding that communications and understanding are the most
effective way to promote ethnic and religious harmony and avoid
misunderstandings, suspicion and conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Islam seminar was co-sponsored by the World Muslim League
(WML) and National Chengchi University in suburban Taipei. The World
Muslim League, headquartered in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, was founded in
1962 to promote Islam, humanitarian aid and cooperation among Islamic
countries and organizations. It is one of the most influential
non-governmental organizations in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the WML has organized an
international seminar on Islam in Taiwan. Chien said he is glad to
see many Islamic experts from around the world travel to Taipei to
attend the two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
Chien said the history of Islam in Taiwan dates to the mid-17th
century when a group of Muslims immigrated to Taiwan from the Chinese
mainland together with Koxinga or Cheng Cheng-kung (1624-1662), the
leader of an anti-Manchu resistance movement after the fall of the
Ming dynasty in mainland China who ousted the Dutch from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, Chien said, Muslims were concentrated in
Tamsui, Tainan, Lukang, Yunlin and Ilan. At present, Taiwan has about
50,000 Muslim citizens.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chien said, about 50,000 Muslims from Islamic
countries are working in Taiwan. Taiwan now has six mosques that
sponsor many Islamic religious activities and festivities each year,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Muslims organize a delegation to embark on an annual
pilgrimage to Mecca and serve as Taiwan's goodwill ambassadors to the
Islamic world, he said. In the past two years, President Chen
Shui-bian has met with the delegation members upon their return to
express his support for Islamic cultural development.
</P>
<P>
President Chen, who is busy with his re-election campaign, issued
a congratulatory message on the opening of the Islam seminar, which
was read at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In his written message, Chen said Taiwan upholds religious
freedom and cultural diversity. In the past four years, Chen said,
his administration has stepped up efforts to help local people better
understand Islamic culture and to promote exchanges among different
religions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, WML Secretary-General Dr. Abdullah
Al-Turki said many people have misunderstood Islam due to terrorism
advocated by some Islamic extremists. In fact, he said, Islam, like
other major religions, advocates peace.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is consistently our ultimate goal. We firmly oppose
terrorism. The World Muslim League has been striving to preach the
true spirit of Islam and promote exchanges with other religious
groups to enhance mutual understanding," said Al-Turki.
</P>
<P>
During the opening ceremony, Chien decorated Al-Turki
with the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon in recognition of
his contribution to the promotion of cultural exchanges on behalf of
the ROC government.

PASSENGERS ALLOWED TO CARRY UP TO 6,000 RENMINBI IN AND OUT OF TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Passengers entering or leaving Taiwan
are now allowed to carry mainland Chinese currency of up to 6,000
renminbi with them, the Kaohsiung Customs authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At current rates, 6,000 renminbi is about NT$24,300 or US$725.
</P>
<P>
The customs officials said that passengers, particularly inbound
passengers, presumably most of them Taiwan citizens returning from
trips to mainland China, are now allowed to carry renminbi with them
as part of the government's efforts to increase convenience for
people amid the rapid rise in cross-strait exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) adopted the new policy at the end
of 2003 in compliance with a Statute Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area amendment that
was passed by the Legislative Yuan last November.
</P>
<P>
Before last December, mainland Chinese currency was not allowed
to be brought into Taiwan by anyone.
</P>
<P>
MOF officials said that the limit of 6,000 renminbi was decided
upon after the MOF took into consideration Taiwan's overall economic
development as well as the practices adopted by other countries.
</P>
<P>
The exact amount could be increased once Taiwan and mainland
China sign a bilateral currency clearance pact, MOF officials said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the maximum amount in foreign currency that people are
allowed to carry with them into or out of Taiwan is US$10,000.
Inbound and outbound passengers are also allowed to carry Taiwan
currency of up to NT$60,000 with them, according to the country's
laws.

More than 600 foreign journalists from
200-odd media organizations have arrived in Taiwan to cover the March
20 presidential election as well as Taiwan's first-ever nationwide
referendum scheduled for the same day, the Government Information
Office (GIO) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, scholars and researchers from 22 foreign academic
groups and think tanks are also expected to arrive to observe and
collect first-hand information about the presidential election and
referendum, GIO officials said.
</P>
<P>
GIO officials said the arrival of such a large number of foreign
newspeople and scholars indicates that the international community is
paying much attention to the upcoming presidential election -- a
close race -- and the landmark referendum, which symbolizes the
progress of Taiwan's democratization.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign media organizations, 53 have come from six
countries in North and Latin America, 59 from 14 countries in Europe
and 102 from 17 countries and areas in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan's first-ever nationwide referendum to be held March 20,
the Taiwan voters will be asked two questions. First, whether they
agree that the government should acquire more advanced weapons to
strengthen its anti-missile defenses if mainland China refuses to
remove its ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan. Second, whether they
would agree that the government should negotiate with mainland China
on establishing a "peace and stability" framework in order to build
consensus and for the welfare of people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.

JUSTICE, INTERIOR MINISTRIES RESPECT CEC DECISION ON MISCAST BALLOTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials from both the Ministry of
Justice and the Ministry of the Interior said Monday that the
ministries respect the latest decision that the Central Election
Commission (CEC) has made on the controversial issue of miscast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan invited officials from the CEC, the Ministry
of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior to report on validity
issue after the CEC finally decided Sunday, less than a week before
the presidential election and Taiwan's first-ever referendum slated
for March 20, that miscast ballots will be counted invalid.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of the Interior Chien Tai-lang said that the CEC's
decision that presidential ballots cast in boxes designated for
referendum votes will not be counted and vice versa will help
alleviate doubts and worries of the electorate and contribute to
facilitate a smooth election day March 20.
</P>
<P>
After many twists and turns, the CEC finally decided Sunday that
miscast ballots in the March 20 presidential election and referendum
will be considered invalid.
</P>
<P>
CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng made the announcement after all CEC
commissioners discussed the validity issue for three hours at an
extraordinary session.
</P>
<P>
"We have come to the conclusion that presidential election
ballots cast into the boxes provided for the referendum will not be
counted and vice versa, " Huang said, adding that the decision was
made in line with the "expectations of major political parties and
mainstream public opinion."
</P>
<P>
Huang's announcement marked yet another policy change for the CEC
in one week in handling the upcoming presidential election and
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Huang said miscast election and referendum ballots
should be counted as valid. As a result, he said, the outcome of the
presidential election would have to be announced twice. The first
announcement would be made when all ballots in the boxes for
presidential election were tallied and the second would be made when
the boxes for referendum ballots were counted, in case any
presidential votes were found to have been cast in the referendum
boxes.

<P>
The decision came under fire from the opposition camp on the
grounds that since the act of mistakenly casting presidential
election ballots into the referendum ballot boxes is illegal, such
miscast ballots should not be regarded as valid.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure, the CEC called a provisional meeting
Sunday to review its previous decision. After a heated debate among
CEC commissioners, the CEC finally decided to invalidate all miscast
ballots to avoid any controversy.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said Sunday that the Cabinet
respects the CEC's decision and hopes that the commission will not
make any more changes.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator
Tsai Huang-lang, a DPP party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said that
the CEC made its latest decision with half a heart Sunday under huge
pressure from the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " which has warned
that prolonged time for vote counting and result announcements might
cause post-election rioting.
</P>
<P>
Tsai urged the "pan-blue alliance" not to incite trouble and
create confusion by continuing to look for faults in electoral
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Legislative caucuses of all major political parties hailed the
CEC's latest decision Sunday, saying that the new decision will help
speed up vote counting on election day.

1976: Gen. Ro Jae Hyun, chairman of the South Korean Joint Chiefs
of Staff, arrives in Taipei for a four-day visit.

NTUA LAUNCHES BLOOD DONATION DRIVE TO SAVE PROFESSOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Taiwan University of Arts (NTUA)
launched a blood donation drive Tuesday in a bid to save the life of
Prof. Hsieh Chang-fu, who is now in critical condition as a result of
fulminant hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
Hsia Hsueh-li, an associate professor at NTUA's Institute of
Applied Arts Studies, said all healthy people with blood type A are
welcome to donate blood at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH)
where Prof. Hsieh is awaiting liver transplant surgery, which will
require a large amount of type-A blood.
</P>
<P>
People with other blood types are also welcome to donate blood at
NTUH to help other patients in dire need of blood, Hsia noted.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh, 55, an energetic tennis player and a popular professor at
the university, suffered fulminant hepatic failure earlier this
month. NTUH doctors said that a liver transplant would be the only
option to save Hsieh's life. The fatality rate among fulminant
hepatitis patients is 80 percent to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
As of noon Tuesday, five of Hsieh's relatives were undergoing
tests to see whether they are suitable candidates to donate part of
their liver to save Hsieh's life.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh's oldest son, who works in the United States, has flown
back to Taipei to be with his father, while his second son, who
currently studies in mainland China, is expected to fly back later
Tuesday. China Airlines arranged a seat for him after he himself was
unable to book one due to the lack of availability in the run-up to
the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
At the NTUA campus, students have hung yellow ribbons and paper
cranes on trees to cheer up Hsieh, while his students at the NTUA
Institute of Applied Arts Studies have set up a Web site with the
words "Go, go, go! Boss Hsieh!" on the homepage.
</P>
<P>
The owner of a cafe on the NTUA campus claimed Monday that he
will donate part of the income of his restaurant to help out with
Professor Hsieh's medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Fulminant hepatitis, according to NTUH doctors, is an acute
disease apt to hit males in their young to prime years, probably
because of the fact that their immune systems are at their strongest
during that period.
</P>
<P>
Patients of chronic hepatitis B are also liable to be hit with
fulminant hepatitis under certain conditions, such as by smoking or
drinking excessively or by overdosing on fever or pain-killer
medicines that contain such things as acetaminophen, the NTUH doctors
said.

TAIWAN PINEAPPLE CHIEF MAKES PUBLIC DONATIONS TO KMT, PFP

<TEXT>
<P>
A vice chairman of the Taiwan Pineapple
Corp. claimed Tuesday that opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong accepted NT$3 million (US$89,800) from him as
apolitical donation when he was running for Taiwan governor and
during his governorship.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Huang Tsung-hung said that the money was
given to Soong at Kuomintang Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan's residence
in December 1994 and he said he hopes Soong will return the political
donation.
</P>
<P>
Huang claimed that he also donated NT$2.7 million to Tseng, NT$2
million to Legislator Wu Tun-yi, NT$2 million to Legislator Hung
Yu-chien and NT$600,000 to Legislator Chu Feng-chih, among others.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he only made public his political donations to
politicians of the opposition Kuomintang and the PFP and whether
Soong agreed to any conditions offered by him when accepting the
donation, Huang refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
In response, Soong, who is the running mate of KMT Chairman Lien
Chan in the March 20 presidential election, described Huang's claims
as "nonsense," saying that he is not familiar with Huang and does not
want to get involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to local media March 8, Huang also claimed that
Lien accepted NT$100 million from him as a political donation in
1998. The KMT filed a libel suit against him the next day.
</P>
<P>
Describing Huang's accusations as false, lawyer Lin Fu-hung
commissioned by the KMT said that the alleged NT$100 million
political donation was confirmed by the Taipei Prosecutor's Office
during its investigation into an investment project by Zanadau
Development Co. to be a rebate for Liu Tai-ying, former chairman of
the KMT Investment Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rebate was used by Liu for political purposes
and had nothing to do with Lien.

NO BAN ON  PRO, ANTI-REFERENDUM SIGNS AT EXIT POLLS: OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who go to the polls March 20
wearing badges, stickers, armbands or other accessories that show
their support or opposition to the referendum will not be stopped by
poll workers or police unless they constitute a disruption of the
referendum, according to a decision taken by the Executive Yuan
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision will allow opponents of the referendum to wear
stickers calling for a boycott of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Talk show host Chao Sao-kang said during a televised referendum
debate Sunday that a ban on anti-referendum stickers would be an
infringement of the constitutional right of free expression and he
added that he will wear a sticker to the polls March 20 and challenge
police to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chia-long, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said the
Executive Yuan's decision was reached with the purpose of carrying
out the first nationwide referendum peacefully and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
People who interrupt the polls by urging or luring others into or
out of casting their referendum votes within 30 meters of the polling
stations will be asked to stop before being told to stop and any
punishments will only be meted out after the referendum, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin said that voters are prohibited from carrying any
presidential candidate's badges, stickers, campaign caps or other
accessories to within 30 meters of the polling stations, as laid out
in the Presidential Election and Recall Law.
</P>
<P>
Presidential election exit polls of the type a local television
station plans to conduct on election day for the first time, will not
be prohibited according to Central Election Commission Chairman
Huang Shih-cheng, as long as the polls are carried out more than 30
meters from the polling stations and as long as results are not
released until after 4 p.m. when the polling stations close.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lin Chia-long cautioned that anyone who wants to
held exit polls should conduct them "carefully," as incorrect results
are very likely in such a close race, which could trigger chaos in
the country.
</P>
<P>
As a newly developed democracy, Lin said, Taiwan seems unprepared
for exit polls. Voters do not trust pollsters and might not tell them
their true voting patterns, which would undermine the accuracy of the
exit polls.
</P>
<P>
Citing an exit polls that showed an opposite result to the final
outcome of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Lin warned that a
similar mistake in Taiwan could prompt unpredictable reactions from
the supporters of the losing candidate.
</P>
<P>
"The government won't interfere with any mass media decision to
do an exit poll, but anyone who wants to do it should do it in a
responsible way," Lin said.

ROC PROTESTS AGAINST CHINA-FRANCE JOINT NAVAL EXERCISE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
lodged a strong protest to France and mainland China Tuesday for
their ongoing large-scale joint naval exercise that coincides with
Taiwan's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Describing the exercise as "military intimidation toward Taiwan,"
the MOFA claimed it is also aimed at influencing the results of
Taiwan's March 20 presidential election and its first-ever nationwide
referendum to be held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, keen to strengthen ties with
Beijing and win a firm footing for French business in the rapidly
growing mainland market, sided with Beijing in January in opposing
Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on missile defense alongside the
election, according to a MOFA news release.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also came up with a proposal that the European Union lift
its arms embargo against the mainland with a view to facilitating
France's acquisition of lucrative business contracts from Beijing,
the MOFA said. At a sensitive moment -- with Taiwan on the point of
holding its presidential election -- the French president decided to
conduct a large-scale naval exercise with Beijing, the ministry
added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the government cannot accept the French moves, the
Foreign Ministry said it has expressed great discontent to Director
Elisabeth Laurin of the French Institute in Taiwan, France's de facto
embassy in Taipei, and has asked the French side to offer a
reasonable explanation.
</P>
<P>
Chirac twice said publicly on two different occasions when
meeting with visiting mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao in January
that France opposes Taiwan independence and that the island will be
committing a "grave mistake" that could destabilize the region by
holding a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The mainland considers the referendum a plot to promote Taiwan
independence. It menaced Taiwan with missile tests and war games in
the run-up to the island's first direct presidential elections in
1996 to try to dissuade voters from re-electing then-President Lee
Teng-hui, but the move backfired, with Lee winning by a landslide.

The government will encourage foreign

offering various incentives, including tax exemptions for the
capitalization of transferred technology in joint-ventures, a
government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ho Mei-yueh, vice chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for

<P>
According to the regulations, Ho said, domestic hi-tech and
biotechnology companies can buy foreign technology with cash or
shares. However, while the money foreign companies earn from selling
technology is exempt from taxation, shares are subject to company
income tax, she added.
</P>
<P>
The measure is aimed at alleviating the financial burden on
domestic companies in the research and development of new technology,

MOFA SEES GOOD NEW RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
concerned about the situation in Russia following the conclusion of a
presidential poll there a day earlier, but it will not make any
comment until the final election outcome is made public later this
month, a ministry spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin-chung, deputy director-general of the MOFA's West Asian
Affairs Department, said the MOFA will not deliver any comment on the
Russian presidential election until March 25, when the final results
are released, despite the fact that incumbent President Vladimir
Putin is commonly assumed to have won the contest easily and
comfortably.
</P>
<P>
However, Lin pledged that the MOFA will take the initiative to
boost bilateral communication and understanding, including on the two
issues to be raised in Taiwan's historic referendum to be held on the
same day as its March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Lin further pointed out that this year's work plans devised by
his department with regard to Russia are aimed at greatly enhancing
and upgrading substantive exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a report aired by mainland China's CCTV, mainland
Chinese President Hu Jintao phoned Putin Monday immediately after the
initial election result showed that Putin was expected to win the
race for a second term by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the two men exchanged opinions on
cross-Taiwan Strait issues, with Putin expressing opposition to
Taiwan independence and its planned referendum this weekend for the
sake of security and stability across the strait.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the MOFA will check the facts of the report before
commenting on it.
</P>
<P>
Kuo An, deputy director-general of the MOFA's Information and
Cultural Affairs Department, stressed that President Chen Shui-bian
and relevant government authorities have repeatedly made it clear
that Taiwan's referendum is designed only to further cement Taiwan's
democracy and not to provoke tension in the region.

DPP REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO DOWNSIZING LEGISLATURE

Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)

<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) reaffirmed Tuesday its determination to cut the size of the
Legislative Yuan after a weekly meeting of its Central Standing
Committee, according to DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung.
</P>
<P>
Chang said party chairman and President Chen Shui-bian, who was
campaigning for Saturday's presidential election in Taichung Tuesday,
did not preside over the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The DPP chiefs of seven counties and cities in southern Taiwan
attended the meeting to hear Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh's plan for
soliciting more votes in southern Taiwan for Chen in the remaining
days before the election. Hsieh is in charge of Chen's campaign in
the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lee Ying-yuan, who is Chen's deputy campaign manager,
gave a briefing on the campaign rallies to be organized around the
island on the eve of the polling day.
</P>
<P>
Chang claimed that Chen is far ahead of his rival, opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, in southern Taiwan, but the DPP has
nevertheless lined up various campaign activities March 19 as a
culmination of Chen's campaign.
</P>
<P>
Although the whole country is preoccupied with the election, the
DPP passed a resolution to reaffirm its commitment to reducing the
number of seats in the legislature by half and urged the Legislative
Yuan to pass a bill to this effect before polling day.
</P>
<P>
The DPP policy-making body also reiterated the government's
determination to prevent vote-buying in the election.

MILITARY ON FULL ALERT AHEAD OF PRESIDENTIAL POLL: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The military has heightened its alert in
the run-up to the March 20 presidential election and Taiwan's first
nationwide referendum to be held simultaneously, the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular MND news conference, Maj. Gen. Huang
Suey-sheng said the ministry is also closely watching mainland
China's military movements, particularly the activities of its
submarine fleet and missile units.
</P>
<P>
So far, Huang said, the MND has not detected any abnormal
mainland military deployments.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the armed forces will go on a 39-hour heightened alert
to help ensure that the presidential election and the referendum on
missile defense and relations with the mainland proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the military's main role is to allow voters to "cast
their sacred ballots" in a safe and stable environment, Huang said,
the military will be at "heightened levels of alert" in the 39 hours
beginning 5 p.m. March 19 and ending at 8 a.m. March
21.
</P>
<P>
"If any abnormalities are detected, the military will react
swiftly according to contingency plans, " Huang said without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has objected to the referendum, which it considers a
first step toward an eventual vote on de jure Taiwan independence.
The island's fraught relations with the mainland have figured
prominently in the tight presidential contest between incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, and his
sole challenger, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan.

CANADA URGED TO ASSIST TAIWAN IN ITS WHO BID

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One more member of the Canadian Parliament
called on the Canadian government Monday to take concrete action to
support Taiwan's entry into the World Health Organization (WHO) as an
observer.
</P>
<P>
During a parliamentary interpellation session, Stephane Bergeron
of the Quebec Party, urged the Ottawa authorities to support Taiwan's
WHO bid in line with a proposal adopted by the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Bergeron noted that the Parliament passed a proposal in favor of
Taiwan's participation in the WHO as an observer about one year ago
when the island urgently needed the world health body's assistance
because of the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
</P>
<P>
One year later, the island faced a rising threat from the H5N2
avian flu virus, Bergeron pointed out. "Why is our government still
reluctant to assist Taiwan in obtaining WHO observer status or push
for an amendment to the WHO organic statutes to facilitate its
accession?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
In response, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham
pointed out that any amendments to WHO organic statutes must be
approved by all members. He added that Canada has maintained close
medical cooperation with Taiwan to assure that its people obtain
enough information on health preservation and any needed medical
assistance.

Foreign visitors are on their way to
Taiwan to observe the March 20 presidential election, a spokesman for
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Lord Russell Johnston, president of the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Council of Europe and a long-term supporter of Taiwan
and human rights in the international community, will arrive
Wednesday and stay until March 21 to observe the presidential vote
and Taiwan's first-ever referendum, to be held on the same day.
</P>
<P>
While here, Johnston will pay a visit to first lady Wu Shu-chen,
Foreign Affairs Minister Eugene Chien, the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy affiliated to the MOFA and the Government Information
Office.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he will visit the campaign headquarters of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and those of the rival
"pan-blue alliance" formed by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP).
</P>

FIRST LADY APOLOGIZES FOR NEGLIGENCE IN STOCK TRADING REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First lady Wu Shu-chen apologized Tuesday
for failing to report five stock trading deals to the watchdog
Control Yuan's public functionaries assets report department between
2000 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen offered the
apology on behalf of the first lady at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"Wu has asked me to convey her deep apology to the general public
over her negligence in her assets reports, " Chiou said, adding that
Wu's accountant had already reported the omitted stock trading deals
to the Control Yuan earlier in the day and has paid the fines due in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly revised public functionaries assets report
regulations, any single stock trading deal worth over NT$10 million
should be reported to the Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog
body.
</P>
<P>
Chiou said the omitted stock trading deals were found recently
while the accountant was handling the first family's assets trust
affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the period from President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration in
May 2000 until the end of last year, Chiou said, five of Wu's stock
trading deals were not reported, including two deals worth between
NT$22 million and NT$27 million, as well as three deals worth between
NT$12 million and NT$13 million.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was special in those deals. The omission mainly
resulted from negligence. The first lady did not purposely hide
information about those five deals," Chiou claimed.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who has been confined to a wheelchair since being run over by
a truck in 1985, reportedly took up stock trading as a "hobby, " but
it has become a hot presidential campaign topic in recent months.
</P>
<P>
In a televised debate Feb. 21, the opposition presidential
candidate, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, brought up the issue. In
response, Chen said even though his wife has not committed any
wrongdoing or insider trading in her investments, he agreed that her
actions were "inappropriate" in consideration of her capacity as the
first lady. He said his wife will not conduct any stock trading deals
prior to the March 20 presidential election and also made a public
pledge that he will put his family assets into "blind trust" after
the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
To honor his promise, Chiou said, Chen asked the accountant to
begin preparations for putting his family assets into trust and it
was in this process that Wu's omitted stock trading deals were
spotted, Chiou explained.

Chang Ching-fang filed a libel suit Tuesday against a fugitive
business tycoon who claimed Chang tried to force him to cooperate
with Chang in bidding for the construction of a thermal electricity
plant in Taoyuan in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chang went to the Prosecutor's Office at the Taipei District
Court to present a written complaint, accusing Tuntex founder Chen
You-hao of defaming him at a news conference in Los Angeles the
previous day for claiming that Chang was trying to have a finger in
the pie when Tuntex was bidding for the construction of the Tatan
thermal electricity plant.
</P>
<P>
Showing a tape recording of an alleged conversation between an
executive from Tuntex and an aide to Chang, Chen said in Los Angeles
that his company was searched by investigators after refusing to meet
Chang's request of having the building of the power plant undertaken
by a contractor named by him and Tuntex eventually failed to win the
bid.
</P>
<P>
Chang is the fourth DPP figure who has filed complaints of libel
against Chen You-hao in recent days after first lady Wu Shu-chen,
President Chen Shui-bian's deputy chief of staff Chen Che-nan and
Chang Jing-sen, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning

Tuesday.

TFD, a non-profit group promoted by the Ministry of Foreign

Taiwan scholars also exchanged views extensively with their U.S.
counterparts on the presidential election and the first nationwide

Bellocchi, who is familiar with party politics and the voting
pattern of different ethnic groups in Taiwan, asked if Hakka people's
support for the pro-unification Kuomintang (KMT) has slipped since
the KMT has no longer stressed unification.
</P>
<P>
Hsiao said that Hakka people's strong support for the KMT in the
past was manipulated by the KMT's local factions, but the Hakka group
now wants to have their own say, and the support for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has increased gradually.

More than 16.5 million Republic of China
citizens are eligible to vote in this Saturday's election for the
11th-term president and vice president, the Central Election
Commission (CEC) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of eligible voters stands at 16,507,179,
according to the newly released CEC election gazette.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of citizens eligible to vote in Taiwan's
first-ever nationwide referendum on missile defense and relations
with mainland China to be held alongside the presidential election
totals 16,497,746.
</P>
<P>
The CEC said the difference between the two numbers mainly
results from the fact that ROC overseas expatriates who have
registered for the presidential election but do not have legal
residence in Taiwan cannot vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to the CEC tallies, densely populated Taipei County is
the largest "vote bank," with 2,685,778 eligible voters.

deeming the questions unnecessary, both sides need to step up
communications.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that there is no change in basic Taiwan-U.S.
relations, and both sides maintain close exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Noting that mainland China had stressed in the past that the
March 20 referendum will lead Taiwan down the path toward
independence, Chiou said he hoped that other nations will not listen
only to Beijing's words.
</P>
<P>
The referendum mainly aims to strengthen the democratic process
in Taiwan, Chiou said, adding that he hopes Taiwan's efforts in
democratization will become a beacon to influence mainland China.
</P>
<P>
He also said that if the referendum fails to pass, it is likely
to be interpreted that Taiwan is suitable for the "one country, two
systems" formula cherished by mainland China.
</P>
<P>
This is why President Chen Shui-bian said that the failure of the
referendum will mean a victory for China, Chiou added.
</P>
<P>
If the referendum fails, Chiou said, the government will be
unable to increase the budget for national defense to purchase
anti-missile equipment, although it will not mean that the government
will not buy anti-missile equipment, adding that the national budget
already passed will continue to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Even if the referendum is rejected as some have advocated because
they deem President Chen has called it illegally, relations with the
United States will not be affected, as the government will continue
to carry out the implementation of its national defense budget in a
responsible way.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the presidential election, Chiou said that though
President Chen and his sole rival from the "pan-blue alliance, " Lien
Chan, are running neck and neck, he believes that the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will triumph.
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine that the DPP will lose this battle," Chiou
said, adding however that "if Lien wins, it will be the beginning of
the power struggle within the 'pan-blue alliance.'"

CHEN WILL ADDRESS CROSS-STRAIT DEADLOCK IF RE-ELECTED: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will address the
cross-Taiwan Strait political deadlock in a wiser and more pragmatic
manner if re-elected, Chen's top aide said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the leadership in Beijing will also face the
cross-strait issue differently after the March 20 presidential
election, said Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the Presidential
Office and executive director of Chen's campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Chiou made the remarks in response to a question raised by
foreign media at a government-sponsored news conference designed to
brief international media about the presidential election and an
accompanying referendum to be held March 20.
</P>
<P>
On the question as to how President Chen will build mutual trust
with the Beijing leadership after he is re-elected, Chiou said he
does not think that President Chen and the Beijing leaders can build
a relationship of mutual trust in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Chiou added, however, that it is believed that both the Beijing
leadership and President Chen will face the cross-strait issue wisely
and pragmatically.
</P>
<P>
Noting that pragmatism is more needed to solve the thorny
cross-strait issue than the concept of trust, Chiou said President
Chen will see to it, if re-elected, that a working group is
established to build a cross-strait peace and stability framework,
which will eventually become a regular mechanism to handle and
oversee all cross-strait exchanges and affairs.
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Chiou added, the cross-strait peace and stability
framework can start from cultural and economic affairs in instances
where the two sides are unable to address political differences.
</P>
<P>
Chiou also stressed that political differences may be challenging
to the development of cross-strait relations, but they should not be
reasons for barring both sides from engaging in interactions.
</P>
<P>
Chen's top campaign aide also lamented that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has long mistakenly been regarded as
pro-independence and being half-hearted in facilitating cross-strait
relations.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, he said, the DPP has put forward more than
20 policies over the past four years to facilitate the development of
cross-strait relations, including helping aged military veterans to
return to their mainland Chinese homelands for visits or to settle,
changing the "no haste, be patient" policy toward mainland China and
putting into force the "mini three links."

BRAZILIAN MANUFACTURER TO PROMOTE SMALL PASSENGER PLANE IN TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the expected opening of domestic
airports to privately owned planes, a Brazilian aircraft manufacturer
will come to Taiwan to show its products.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer, which specializes in the production of small
jet passenger planes, will visit Taiwan Wednesday. Domestic air
carrier Trans Asia Airways will be in charge of ground operations,
while Trans Asia Airways Chairman Fan Chi-chiang will also test fly
the plane.
</P>
<P>
The small jet passenger plane can accommodate 70 people and can
cater to special needs. The plane carries a price tag of around
US$20 million, but the actual selling price could be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Under current civil aeronautics regulations, individuals can own
aircraft, but since there is no hangar facilities for them at
Taiwan's airports, plane owners here must park their aircraft outside
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said that it considers
the regulations out of date and is revising them.
</P>
<P>
In addition, domestic airline traffic has continued to drop.
After the inauguration of Taiwan's first high-speed rail linking
Kaohsiung and Taipei in 2005, this traffic is expected to shrink
further, and there will be more space for private planes to park, CAA
officials said.

AVENGER SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES DEPLOYED IN TAIPEI: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense confirmed
Tuesday that a number of Avenger surface-to-air missiles have been
deployed in Taipei City and around the greater Taipei area since late
last year.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said at a
regular defense ministry news conference that a number of Avenger
missile units have been in positions around Taipei since last
December under a security contingency program.
</P>
<P>
Noting that all of the nation's weaponry deployments are
conducted after thorough planning and in accordance with strategic
needs, Huang said the Avenger missiles are only to increase the
country's security preparedness and their deployment poses no threat
to the general public.
</P>
<P>
However, Huang declined to disclose exactly how many Avenger
missiles are in and around Taipei and whether the deployment is
temporary or permanent, saying that the information is classified.
</P>
<P>
According to defense ministry sources, Taiwan ordered the Avenger
ground-to-air missiles from the United States in 1996 and delivery
was made secretly before the March 18 presidential election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Avenger missiles, a pedestal-mounted system with two pods --
each containing four Stinger missiles - is designed to be mounted on
the back of a Humvee and requires only two crew members to fire -- a
driver and a gunner. The Avenger has an effective range of 10
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The missiles have been attached to the air defense arms of each
of Taiwan's three field armies.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's extensive air defense shield is composed of U.S.-made
Patriot, Hawk and Chaparral missiles, as well as indigenously
produced "Tien Kung" missiles, which are deployed around Taiwan and
its outlying islands.

ROC OFFICIALS SEEK REMOVAL OF BANS ON IMPORTS OF TAIWAN FOWL VIA WTO
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva, March 16 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's top trade official in Geneva said
Monday that those countries that have banned or restricted the import
of fowl from Taiwan lack scientific evidence for implementing the
measures and have taken inappropriate actions in dealing with the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent representative to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), made the comments at a meeting designed to
seek support for the removal of the bans through the WTO multilateral
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting held by Taiwan's permanent mission to the WTO,
delegates from nine WTO countries and areas that have imposed a ban
on the import of fowl from Taiwan were invited to listen to
explanations given by Taiwan health and agricultural authorities on
the efforts that the island has made in its fight against bird flu.
The nine countries and areas are Japan, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have banned fowl imports from Canada and the
United States due to the outbreaks of avian flu in those two
countries. Twenty-one countries have restricted imports of fowl from
Taiwan despite the fact the island has only seen a few cases of
low-risk pathogenic H5N2 bird flu virus infection among its fowl.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that most of the fowl raised in Taiwan are for
domestic consumption and that the ban and restrictions imposed by
other countries have had only a minor impact on the island's trade.
</P>
<P>
As the WTO's Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures is
scheduled to hold a two-day meeting beginning March 17, Yen has
decided to take the opportunity to use the WTO's multilateral
mechanism to directly call for those countries to remove their bans
and restrictions on Taiwan fowl imports, as well as to invite
delegates from the nine countries to better their understanding of
Taiwan's efforts on bird flu-prevention ahead of the upcoming
gathering.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Monday's meeting, Yen emphasized that both the WHO and
the World Organization for Animal Health(OIE) have confirmed that
outbreaks of avian flu in Taiwan are not caused by the H5N1 strain
and that Taiwan had even actively informed the two organizations of
its H5N2 situation despite the fact the OIE had only asked those
countries affected by outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu virus to make a
report to the organization. He said Taiwan deserves to be seen as a
model in dealing with avian flu.
</P>
<P>
A Council of Agriculture official also said at the meeting that
the restrictions on fowl imports from Taiwan are "unnecessary
quarantine measures" because Taiwan has only registered a few cases
of H5N2 bird flu which do not need to be reported to the OIE.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing Taiwan's "high standard" measures in dealing with
bird flu after listening to the explanations from the Taiwan
officials, delegates from the nine countries promised to pass on the
information to their governments for reference in making a decision
on the matter.

MND PLAYS DOWN CHINA-FRANCE NAVAL EXERCISE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
played down a rare mainland Chinese-French joint naval exercise
Tuesday, saying it is mainly to practice maritime emergency search
and rescue skills.
</P>
<P>
MND spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng made the remarks at a
regular news conference. During the press briefing, Huang was asked
whether the ongoing joint military exercise is aimed at influencing
the results of Taiwan's presidential election and its first-ever
nationwide referendum to be held simultaneously this weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to information collected by the military, Huang said,
two French warships visited the northern mainland Chinese port city
of Qingdao from March 12-16, and Tuesday's joint training exercise
off Qingdao -- about 1,250 km (780 miles) from Taiwan's northernmost
point -- was part of the itinerary of the two French warships'
mainland visit.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the joint training drill was mainly designed for
mainland Chinese and French naval personnel to practice basic
maritime emergency rescue and relief skills and tactics.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China's official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday that
in Tuesday's exercise, a French anti-submarine destroyer and a
corvette class warship would take part beside a mainland Chinese
destroyer, a supply vessel and a ship with a helicopter landing pad.
</P>
<P>
The drill was mainland China's first to be conducted on the high
seas with a major Western power, Xinhua said. Mainland China held its
first-ever joint naval exercise with Pakistan last October.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, keen to strengthen ties with
mainland China and win a firm footing for French business in the
rapidly growing mainland market, sided with Beijing in January in
opposing Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on missile defence
alongside its March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan responded by suspending high-level government exchanges
with France.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China has derided the referendum as a plot to promote
Taiwan independence. It menaced Taiwan with missile tests and war
games in the run-up to the island's first direct presidential
elections in 1996 to try to dissuade voters from re-electing
then-President Lee Teng-hui. The move backfired, with Lee winning by
a landslide.

<P>
An private group urging people to cast
invalid votes in the forthcoming presidential election staged a
protest between the campaign headquarters of the two candidates in
the race Wednesday in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The "Millions for Invalid Votes Union" blamed the two candidates
for ignoring the public desire for a fair and just society.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Chun-chi, a leader of the union, said both candidates and
the political forces they reflect in the race are "rotten apples, "
with voters being forced to choose between them. Whoever wins will be
a loss for the public, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In the protest, 10 members of the union, with five dressed in
green, the color of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and five
dressed in blue, the color of the opposition Kuomintang and People
First Party, moved a chain made of 100 rotten apples between the two
candidates' campaign headquarters which is 3.5 kilometers apart.
</P>
<P>
Beginning at 9 a.m. Wednesday from the campaign headquarters of
President Chen Shui-bian, Cheng said the protest will last for 26
hours until 11 a.m. Thursday when the rotten apple chain arrives at
the campaign headquarters of the other candidate, Lien Chan. A total
of 120 union members will take part in the protest and move the chain
in shifts.

BAN ON DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT SHIPPING REMAINS IN PLACE: KEELUNG PORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The central government has not lifted its
ban on direct shipping between Taiwan and mainland China, and owners
of the vessels, including those of foreign nationalities, who break
the rule will be punished with fines in accordance with the law, a
spokesman for the Keelung Harbor Bureau said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after local media outlets reported
that a Panamanian-flagged cruise ship -- the Seven Seas Voyager --
departed for Shanghai Tuesday afternoon directly from Keelung Harbor
in northern Taiwan after having received permission from the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that the bureau did not give its
approval to the vessel and made it clear that it will issue a fine to
its owner. He added that violators can be penalized with a fine
ranging from NT$3 million to up to NT$15 million (about US$450,000)
in accordance with the Statute Governing the Relations Between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.
</P>
<P>
The bureau will look into the report and the ship's owner will be
punished if it is proven to be true, he said, adding that the bureau
has asked the ship's agent in Taiwan to inform the captain of the
situation and possible fine if he cannot provide documents issued by
port authorities in a third country or area to show that the ship
really stopped there en route to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Direct trade, transport and postal links across the Taiwan Strait
are banned in the absence of formal contacts between Taiwan and

MAC CHIEF EMPHASIZES LEGITIMACY OF PLANNED REFERENDUM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen laid emphasis Wednesday on the legitimacy and
indispensability of Taiwan's first nationwide referendum to be held
in conjunction with the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Referendums are indispensable in the process of democratic
development and cross-Taiwan Strait relations promotion, Tsai said
while delivering a speech on the planned referendum and perspectives
for national development at the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In response to the opposition camp's query as to why the DPP
government has linked the referendum to the March 20 presidential
election, Tsai said if it had not been linked to the election, the
ruling and opposition parties would haven't weathered all the
difficulties to pass the Referendum Law and the people of Taiwan
would stand no chance of being able to vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that people have the right to express their viewpoints
on issues concerning national development and cross-strait relations,
Tsai said that in the process of the deepening of Taiwan's democracy,
several of Taiwan's allies have expressed their concern over whether
the referendum will have an adverse impact on the stability across
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
However, the top planner of Taiwan's policies toward mainland
China added that the international community's inquietude was
dissipated after President Chen Shui-bian made public the two
questions to be on the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The questions are whether Taiwan should increase its anti-missile
defenses if mainland China refuses to remove the missiles it has
aimed at Taiwan, and whether the government should negotiate with
Beijing for the establishment of an interaction mechanism for peace
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the March 20 referendum will help forge a national
consensus on the promotion of national development and cross-strait
relations, Tsai said that if the majority of eligible voters cast a
"yes" vote in the referendum, the Beijing leadership will dare not
look down on the island.
</P>
<P>
Tsai further said that the planned referendum is aimed at
pursuing peace across the Taiwan Strait. "The international community
will understand our stance as long as we explain the referendum
purpose to our allies with patience," she added.

TAIWAN PROVINCE CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES PROSECUTOR FOR INDICTING HIM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan Provincial Governor Lin Kuang-hua
criticized a prosecutor in Hsinchu Wednesday who indicted him a
couple of days ago for breaching the Public Officials Election and
Recall Law saying that the move was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
With three days to go before the presidential election, Lin said
at a news conference that the prosecutor indicted him with the
intention to tarnish President Chen Shui-bian's administration, of
which the provincial governor is a senior official.
</P>
<P>
President Chen, who is also the chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , is engaging in a close race against
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
"Although this indictment doesn't mean I am guilty, it is still a
heavy blow to my image," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The indictment arose from the 2001 election when Lin was running
on a DPP ticket for a second term as magistrate of Hsinchu County. He
accused his rival in the race, Cheng Yung-chin from the KMT, of vote-
buying.
</P>
<P>
The indictment came after a three-year investigation.
Prosecutors determined that Lin had made groundless accusations against
Cheng to hurt his chances of winning the election.
</P>
<P>
Lin claimed that Cheng, who did go on to win the 2001 election,
made similar accusations against him in the lead-up to the election
but the prosecutor in charge of the investigation didn't bother to
look into them, not to mention indict Cheng. This casts into
question the fairness of the prosecutor's investigation, Lin
contended.
</P>
<P>
Although losing the race for county chief, Lin was named
provincial chairman in 2003 and doubles as a senior adviser to the
president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cheng said Wednesday he was pleased that it was Lin
who was indicted and not him although each of them accused the other
of violating the Public Officials Election and Recall Law.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as ridiculous Lin's claims that the prosecutor was
biased for political reasons, saying that since his KMT is the
opposition party now, how could it be the one pulling strings to get
an indictment against Lin?

BRAZILIAN AIRCRAFT MAKER TO TAP CROSS-STRAIT DIRECT FLIGHT MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Brazilian commercial jetliner
manufacturer displayed a new model of small passenger aircraft in
Taiwan Wednesday in the hopes of cashing in on the much-anticipated
opening of direct air links across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
EMBRAER, a listed aircraft manufacturer, displayed its EMB-170
model passenger jet in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian firm's Asia-Pacific marketing director said he
believes direct cross-strait flight services will open in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
"Our EMB-170 plane, which can accommodate 70 passengers, is very
suitable for cross-strait flights. We believe that the opening of
direct cross-strait air links will bring us new business
opportunities," he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The plane will also be displayed in mainland China later this
month, he added.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's TransAsia Airways offered ground services for the
Brazilian aircraft during the promotion tour of the island. An
airline spokesman said that at the moment, medium and small passenger
planes used in Taiwan are propeller-powered.
</P>
<P>
"The EMB-70 jet can fly faster than prop-powered planes. Once
direct cross-strait air links are opened, we'll consider purchase
this type of plane," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EMBRAER reportedly also set its target on local
business tycoons as Taiwan's civil aviation authorities will revise
regulations to allow domestic airports to accommodate privately owned
planes.
</P>
<P>
Under current civil aeronautics regulations, individuals can own
aircraft, but since there is no hangar facilities for them at
Taiwan's airports, plane owners here must park their aircraft outside
of the country. Once domestic airports are open to private use, more
rich people are expected to buy small planes, airline sources said.
</P>
<P>
EMBRAER, founded in 1969, specializes in manufacturing small jet
passenger planes and military trainers.

QUANTITY OF GARBAGE COLLECTED IN TAIPEI FALLS YEAR ON YEAR

The new kitchen leftover recycling program
and paying for garbage by volume in Taipei City has reduced the
amount of trash collected from January to February by 13.58 percent
compared to last year, according to the Department of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics under the Taipei City Government.
</P>
<P>
The department statistics showed that ever since the new kitchen
leftover recycling program was put into practice at the end of last
year, kitchen waste collected has amounted to around 6,100 metric
tons, resulting in a significant decrease of general garbage
collected. The general garbage volume, on average, was up to around
1,500 metric tons per day, a decrease of 13.58 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The total garbage collected in 2003 was more than 0.74 million
metric tons, a decrease of 17.16 percent from a year earlier, the
statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, Taipei garbage volume from January
to February, on average, was 1,514 metric tons per day, a decrease of
13.58 percent, compared to 1,752 metric tons per day in the same
months a year earlier. Taipei City residents, on average, generated
around 0.58 kilograms per day, a decrease of 12.12 percent
year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Taipei garbage fees were originally imposed along with water
rates, but since the new pay-by-bag garbage fee was put in place in
2000 along with recycling programs, Taipei garbage volume has
declined year by year, based on the statistics.

Taiwan is expected to join the
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) as a "fishing entity"
later this year, the Executive Yuan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan officials made the remarks after the Cabinet
approved documents concerning joining the commission and will send
them to the Legislative Yuan for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that this was another diplomatic achievement
for the nation since Taiwan took part in the Convention on the
Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the
Western and Central Pacific in September 2000.
</P>
<P>
The officials noted that the IATTC is an international fishery
organization to conserve and manage tuna in the east Pacific, and
which currently has 14 members, including the United States, Japan,
France and countries from Central and Southern America.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan joined the IATTC as an observer in 1973, and in 1998
attended its meeting to revise the Antigua Convention in Guatemala,
and the signing of the convention paper in November 2003.
</P>
<P>
After becoming an IATTC member, Taiwan, through the Antigua
Convention, will be able to take part in the policy-making of fishing
regulations, fish haul quotas and annual budget appropriations under
the framework of the IATTC, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
This will protect Taiwan's fishing rights in the east Pacific,
and contribute to its duty of conservation as a major fishing
country, which the officials said will help upgrade the nation's
image.

<P>
The National Police Administration (NPA)
will do everything possible to uphold social order in the run-up to
the March 20 presidential election under four principles: neutrality,
administration of public affairs based upon relevant laws, overall
mobilization, and strict collection of evidence, NPA Director-General
Chang Szu-liang said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chang made the remarks while delivering a report to the Judiciary
Committee under the Legislative Yuan on various measures aimed at
preventing vote-buying and violence as well as maintaining social
order and public security before and after the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Since Oct. 3 last year, the NPA has sponsored six seminars on
vote-buying investigation and violence prevention in order to upgrade
law enforcement personnel's skills in carrying out their missions,
Chang said in his report.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the far-reaching presidential election, local
police authorities have collected and submitted bribery-related
information to prosecutors for references, Chang said, adding that if
deemed necessary, local prosecutors will command police officers and
investigators to strictly crack down on violence or vote-buying
cases.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate the government's determination to thwart corrupt
"black gold" politics, Chang pointed out that the NPA has worked out
a set of measures for local police authorities to effectively crack
down on vote-buying and safeguard social order during election of the
11th president and vice president as well as the holding of the
first-ever nationwide referendum in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chang further said that a strong police presence will be deployed
around various important facilities, such as the Presidential Office,
and campaign headquarters and electoral affairs offices to deal with
possible protests or riots after the announcement of election
results.

FORMER TAIWAN COMFORT WOMEN DEMONSTRATE AT JIA OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four former Taiwan comfort women staged a
protest at the de facto Japanese embassy in Taipei Wednesday to push
the Japanese government to apologize for forcing them into
prostitution during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration at the Japanese Interchange Association (JIA) ,
which represents Japanese interests in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties, was part of an worldwide campaign to demand
an apology and compensation from Japan for its wartime atrocities.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese forced more than 200,000 Asian women to serve as sex
slaves, euphemistically called comfort women, for their soldiers
between 1938 and 1945, including at least 1,200 from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, a group of former South Korean comfort women,
students and human rights activists have staged a sit-in at the
Japanese embassy in Seoul every Wednesday noon. This Wednesday marked
the 600th sit-in of its kind. They invited former comfort women in
Taiwan and the Philippines to stage similar protests. Japanese human
rights activists also demonstrated in Tokyo and Osaka in support of
former Asian comfort women's cause.
</P>
<P>
The four elderly former Taiwan comfort women were accompanied by
senior executives from the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF) ,
including lawyer Wang Ching-feng, in the protest at the JIA office in
Taipei. Several Japanese youths studying in Taiwan also lent their
support by joining the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
They issued a joint appeal, demanding that the Japanese
government offer them a formal apology, financial compensation and
make public all comfort women-related archives.
</P>
<P>
The joint appeal also urged all Asian countries to correctly
recount the comfort women history in their school textbooks as part
of their human rights and peace value education in order to prevent a
recurrence of similar tragedies.
</P>
<P>
The appeal further suggested that Asian countries set up special
museums to preserve historical documents, data and illustrations
regarding the comfort women system adopted by the Japanese wartime
government.
</P>
<P>
In July 1999, nine former Taiwan comfort women filed an appeal
with the Tokyo District Court, demanding a public apology and
financial compensation from the Japanese government. The Tokyo
District Court rejected the appeal in 2002. Two of the plaintiffs
have since died. The Tokyo High Court upheld the district court's
ruling in February this year.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese lawyer has appealed on behalf of the seven surviving
Taiwanese women to the Japanese Supreme Court against the Tokyo High
Court's recent ruling. All of the seven former comfort women are in
their 80s.

LIEN HIT WITH NT$300,000 FINE FOR FAILING TO REPORT PROPERTY IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition presidential candidate Lien
Chan failed to report his ownership of a house in the United States
during his term as vice president and will be fined at least
NT$300,000 (US$9,036), an official of the watchdog Control Yuan said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Yu-nan, director of the Control Yuan's department in charge
of assets-reporting by public functionaries, said that Lien, chairman
of the opposition Kuomintang, had not reported a house in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, under the name of his wife, Lien Fang-yu, throughout
the time he was vice president from 1996 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lien did report the house when he registered with the Central
Election Commission (CEC) recently to run for president, which showed
that Lien had not included the property in his earlier filing.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh noted that several legislators have contended that Lien's
failure to declare the house, a company in the United States and a
foundation in the name of Lien's father makes the case that Lien is
concealing family assets.
</P>
<P>
He said his department will make an overall review of the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is substantial evidence to support the
ownership of the house in Massachusetts, Hsieh said the department
will suggest a fine of NT$300,000, but will wait until the
investigation into other cases is finished to make a final
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
On the alleged withholding of information of a U.S. company,
Hsieh said the department will have to collect more information on
this.
</P>
<P>
The department will ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within
two days to track down the assets of Lien in the United States via
its overseas representative offices, he said.
</P>
<P>
If more information can back up the claims of the legislators
that Lien has deliberately withheld assets or tried to evade taxes,
then the department will urge the integrity commission under the
Control Yuan and tax bureaus to further investigate the cases, Hsieh
said.
</P>
<P>
Between January and March, several legislators from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , including Wang Shu-hui, Lan
Mei-chin, Chiang Chao-yi, Yeh Yi-chin, Lai Ching-teh and Chiu
Chuan-chin reported to the Control Yuan about Lien's house in
Massachusetts, pointing out the discrepancy between Lien's report as
vice president and as presidential candidate to prove that Lien had
not declared his assets honestly.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislators Duan Yi-kang and Lee Wen-chung made the
allegations about Lien's company in the United States to the Control
Yuan Tuesday, and criticized the nation's top watchdog body for
dragging its feet in investigating the reported cases.

EX-PRESIDENT TRIES TO CLAIM MONEY PUT IN ESCROW BY JAMES SOONG
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for former President Lee
Teng-hui filed a motion with the Taipei District Court Wednesday to
have funds deposited with the court in escrow by People First Party
Chairman James Soong returned to Lee as stipulated by court
documents.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Chuang Po-lin said Lee retained him a couple of days ago
and asked him to obtain some NT$300 million (US$8.98 million) that was
put into the court's custody by Soong in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chuang quoted Lee as saying that the money is part of the KMT's
illegally gained assets and should be returned to the people. Chuang
did not elaborate on how Lee intended to do this.
</P>
<P>
The money stems from a case in 2000 when Soong was engaged in a
five-way race for the presidency. The KMT charged Soong with
embezzling some NT$300 million from party coffers when he served as
KMT secretary-general between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Proclaiming his innocence, Soong offered to return the funds, but
the KMT, under the leadership of Lee, refused to take it out of fear
it would temper Soong's guilt. Soong put the money in the custody of
the court instead.
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, the money was to be released into
the guardianship of Lee, who was then chairman of the KMT, for party
use.
</P>
<P>
A prosecutor cleared Soong of the charges in a ruling in 2001
after the presidential election in which Chen Shui-bian won. Lien
Chan, who succeeded Lee as KMT chairman, decided not to pursue the
case and eventually formed an alliance with Soong in the 2004
presidential election. Lien is running for president with Soong as
his vice president.
</P>
<P>
The court turned down the KMT's request for the funds since Lee
was listed in the court's official documents as the recipient of the
money.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Lee has became a staunch supporter of President Chen
in the 2004 presidential election and has gone out of his way to
campaign for Chen's re-election. He criticized the Lien-Soong ticket
as a convenient marriage between two cunning politicians who will do
anything to grab power.

PREMIER ASSURES  BEIYI FREEWAY WILL OPEN NEXT YEAR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun gave his assurance
Wednesday at a ceremony to mark the completion of boring work of a
major tunnel on the Beiyi Freeway that the entire freeway will be
completed next year.
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as "very happy and deeply touched" to see the
boring completed for the west-bound main section of the 12.9-km
Shueishan Tunnel of the 31-km freeway project linking Taipei City in
northern Taiwan with Ilan County in the east, Yu gave his assurances
that the entire freeway will be fully opened to the public by the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
"The completion of the boring work is about two months ahead of
schedule," he went on, adding that "it will take only half an hour to
drive from Taipei to Ilan following the completion of the entire
freeway, a remarkable improvement from the current travel time of two
hours."
</P>
<P>
The premier hailed the boring success as a great achievement and
said that it represents the high standards of Taiwan's construction
and civil engineering technology. He also thanked the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, the Public Construction Commission
and the Veterans Affairs Commission (VAC) for their full support.
</P>
<P>
Yu, himself a native of Ilan, also sent a message to his fellow
countrymen that he has devotedly done his share in pushing for the
much-delayed completion of the Beiyi Freeway construction plan, which
kicked off in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The premier was accompanied at the ceremony by Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san, Public Construction
Commission Chairwoman Kuo Yao-chi and VAC Chairman Teng Tzu-lin, as
well as ministers without portfolio Hu Sheng-cheng and Lin
Feng-sheng.

by the National Palace Museum, a museum official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
F@imp is an annual conference organized by the Committee for

COA LISTS MAJOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE EXPORTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) has
listed four agricultural products -- phalaenopsis (butterfly orchid),
oolung tea, tilapia and mangoes -- as the major agricultural produce
exports.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chia-jung, a specialist of the COA's Department of
International Affairs, noted that Taiwan exports more than 8 million
phalaenopsis every year, worth around US$20 million, mainly to Japan,
the United States and mainland China, making it the world's number
one phalaenopsis exporter and giving the country a major position in
the global floral market.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's oolung tea is world famous, Lin went on, adding that the
world produces around 100,000 tons of oolung tea every year, 20
percent of which comes from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's oolung tea is high quality and production planning is
managed well, giving it a strong competitive edge. The tea is
exported mainly to Japan, Southeast Asia and mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Lin noted that with the supply of white-fleshed sea fish -- which
is most-favored by world consumers -- gradually depleting, tilapia,
which has a fine texture, has the potential to replace sea fish.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan exports 47,000 tons of tilapia every year, making it a
major global exporter. Most of the fish goes to the United States,
Saudi Arabia, Canada, Britain and Kuwait, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Mangoes, the second-largest fruit export in Taiwan after bananas,
mainly go to Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. Taiwan mangoes, which
boast excellent quality and fresh preservation technology during
quarantine and delivery, is highly competitive, he said.

NO MORE CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION BILLS PASSED BY LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 17 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Committee of Constitutional
Amendment under the Legislative Yuan met Wednesday to review a
package of proposals concerning constitutional reform, including
abolishing the National Assembly, but failed to pass any of the
motions.
</P>
<P>
It was the second weekly meeting held by the committee to review
nine proposals on the agenda after it passed the first reading of
three draft constitutional revision bills on legislative reforms last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Based upon the draft amendments, the current 225 seats in the
legislature will be cut to 113 starting from 2008, the current
electoral system will be changed to a "single seat, two votes" system
-- meaning one vote for an individual candidate and another vote for
a political party in each constituency -- and legislators' terms will
be extended to four years from the current three years.
</P>
<P>
According to Legislator Liao Feng-teh, secretary-general of the
opposition Kuomintang's legislative caucus, the legislature is
scheduled to deal with the three draft bills on legislative reforms
this Friday in response to the public's repeated calls for upgrading
the legislature's efficiency and quality.
</P>
<P>
As the legislative caucus of the Alliance of Independent
Legislators insists that the draft constitutional revision bills be
referred once again to joint negotiations, Liao pushed for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's legislative caucus to coordinate
independent lawmakers' stance so that the legislature can pass the
second and third readings of the draft amendments.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chien-ming, chief convener of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union's legislative caucus, said that the public look
forward to the passage of the proposals on halving the number of
legislative seats and extending legislators' terms. He also voiced
the hope that the Legislative Yuan will give priority to dealing with
the draft legislative reform bills.
</P>
<P>
For his part, DPP Legislator Lin Chung-cheng said that all
lawmakers must transcend party lines and take into consideration
national interests while dealing with constitutional reform issues.

GOVERNMENT TO DISSUADE TV STATION FROM EXIT POLL RESULT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although there is no law prohibiting the
conducting and unveiling of exit poll results, the Cabinet will
dissuade a local television from doing so for "moral reasons, " a
government spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chia-lung, a spokesman of the Executive Yuan, made the
remarks after local TV station TVBS said it intended to conduct exit
polls during Saturday's presidential election, although it also said
that it will not publish the results if a majority of the voters
refuse to divulge their ballot choices.
</P>
<P>
Saying that "the media has social responsibility, " Lin added
that media outlets know the situation of Taiwan's social development
and should avoid being the cause of possible clashes and disturbances
during elections.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has not conducted nationwide or credible exit polls
before, " Lin said, claiming that the matter involves "law and
regulations, credibility and social responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"It will be perfectly all right if the exit polls are conducted
for academic research, but at a time when the presidential election
is running neck and neck, great disturbance could erupt if things are
not handled properly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lin said interviewers at the exit polls should stay more than 30
meters from the polling stations. Should disputes or disturbances
erupt, this will create headaches for local police, who will have to
determine if there are violations of election regulations.
</P>
<P>
Exit polls could also interfere with the election, Lin claimed,
adding that TVBS said that it will unveil the results at 4: 01 p.m.
one minute after the polling stations close, although those who are
already in the stations and have received their ballots will be
allowed to complete the voting procedure.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, could trigger disputes.
</P>
<P>
Another thing that needs to be addressed is that if the
television station unveils its result at noon, or spreads rumors to
imply a certain candidate will win the election, the emotions of the
public could be whipped up, Lin cautioned.
</P>
<P>
He said that exit polls also involve a credibility issue, saying
that this is the reason why no academic research bodies have dared to
unveil exit poll results immediately after elections in the past.
</P>
<P>
He said that although Taiwan's electronic media have improved the
credibility of its polls, they are still a far cry from accurately
predicting the result of elections.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that if the results released at 4:01 p.m and
the official election results released at around 7:30 p.m are
significantly different, then it will be a shock to society and the
safety of media staff could be threatened.

<P>
Manual counting of ballots in Saturday's
election and referendum will be a last resort in the event that
computer systems at polling stations fail, Central Election
Commission (CEC) Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Committee of Interior
Affairs, Huang said that basically, all polling stations around the
country will use computers to count ballots and file reports of
election results to the CEC on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Huang said recent concerns that computers might crash as a result
of overload caused by counting both presidential ballots and
referendum votes have been alleviated now that the computers have
been tested with vote-counting simulations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several days, Huang had announced that
vote-counting would all be done manually in anticipation that
computers would be unable to handle both presidential ballots and
referendum votes on the same day, and that polling stations around
the country would report the election results by fax or telephone.
</P>
<P>
Huang also said that on Saturday, after the presidential election
and referendum voting is wrapped up, all polling stations will also
send result reports to the campaign headquarters of both the ruling
"pan-green camp" and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" via computer,
in addition to reporting via computer to the CEC.

PREMIER URGES VOTERS TO CAST REFERENDUM VOTES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged Taiwan voters
Wednesday to cast their referendum votes on the March 20 presidential
election day.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Yu said the 16 million-strong Taiwan
electorate should exercise their democratic rights by casting their
votes in the country's first nationwide referendum.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will be a landmark, unprecedented democratic
practice allowing the people to make direct decisions on public
policies that will be decisive to Taiwan's future, according to Yu.
</P>
<P>
Yu said a great majority of the people of Taiwan attach great
expectations to the referendum, in the belief that it is poised to
take Taiwan a further step toward becoming a more fully functioning
government of the people and by the people.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will also mark a huge step forward in Taiwan's
democratic evolution, Yu added.
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked two questions Saturday on whether they agree
that the government should acquire more advanced weapons to
strengthen its anti-missile defenses if mainland China refuses to
remove its ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan and on whether they
would agree that the government should negotiate with mainland China
on establishing a "peace and stability" framework in order to build
consensus and for the welfare of people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
Allowing the electorate to make right and clear decisions in the
referendum will let the leadership on the opposite side of the Taiwan
Strait know what the Taiwan people need and what they are thinking
about, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will also send messages to Beijing that military
intimidation is not conducive to long-lasting development of
cross-strait relations and is not in the interests of the people on
either side, Yu added.
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, that some people disagree with the
government's stance on the referendum and have decided to boycott it.
Accusing those people of "boycotting the referendum simply for the
sake of boycotting, " Yu claimed that their action not only makes
Taiwan a laughing-stock in the international community, but also
causes the international community to doubt the will and
determination of the people in seeking genuine democracy and opposing
the mainland's hegemony toward Taiwan.

A Taiwan TV personality whose condition
has improved steadily during more than a year of treatment in a
Beijing hospital after suffering a serious injury in a train crash in
London two years ago took a one-month leave from the hospital
Wednesday to head home.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hai-roh, who was a news anchorwoman for Hong Kong-based
Phoenix Television Co., was accompanied by her parents and younger
brother on her flight to Hong Kong Wednesday.

ELECTION WORKERS TO BE GRANTED TWO DAYS OF LEAVE: CEC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Election Commission (CEC)
announced Thursday that all election affairs staff working this
weekend will be given two days of leave to be used anytime after the
election.
</P>
<P>
More than 16 million ROC citizens are eligible to vote in the
March 20 presidential election as well as to cast ballots in Taiwan's
first-ever nationwide referendum.
</P>
<P>
The election staff's workload is expected to be heavier than
usual as the nationwide referendum, on missile defense and relations
with mainland China, will be held simultaneously with the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The CEC has thus decided to give staff working this weekend two
days of leave, a CEC official said, adding that this special
privilege is for this election only.
</P>
<P>
According to the last available poll results which were released
10 days ahead of election day, incumbent President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu were running neck and neck with the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
In the referendum, voters will be asked two questions:
</P>
<P>
1. The people of Taiwan demand that the Taiwan Strait issue be
resolved through peaceful means. Should mainland China refuse to
withdraw the missiles it has targeted at Taiwan and to openly
renounce the use of force against us, do you agree that the
government should acquire more advanced anti-missile weapons to
strengthen Taiwan's self-defense capabilities?
</P>
<P>
2. Do you agree that our government should engage in negotiations
with mainland China on the establishment of a "peace and stability"
framework for cross-Taiwan Strait interactions in order to build
consensus and for the welfare of the peoples of both sides?
</P>
<P>
According to the Referendum Act passed last November, the
referendum will be rendered invalid if fewer than 50 percent of
eligible voters collect a referendum ballot. Taking a ballot, whether
it is then cast or not, is counted as participation in the
referendum. And the referendum is approved if more than 50 percent of
those who take part cast "yes" votes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16,497,746 voters are eligible to vote in the
referendum. Results are expected by 10 p.m. Saturday.

Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh filed a libel

(KMT) a Kaohsiung city government official said Thursday.
</P>

Lin Yao-wen, director of the Information Department under the

Hsieh dismissed Lee's claims as groundless.

The opening of direct cross-Taiwan Strait
links -- trade, transportation and postal services -- is a government
policy, Taiwan's top mainland policy planner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a group of foreign reporters in Taipei to cover the

results of cross-strait talks.

Once the two sides of the strait start negotiations on the
matter, preparations for opening the three links will be put in
motion, Tsai noted.

"All we can do prior to the cross-strait talks is act
unilaterally," she stressed.
</P>

Tsai made the comments while addressing a remark made earlier in

In addition, scholars and researchers from 22 foreign academic

In addition to electing the president and vice president,
Taiwan's voters will also cast two additional ballots for the two
questions put forth in the referendum. The questions are whether
Taiwan should increase its anti-missile defenses if mainland China
refuses to remove the missiles it has aimed at Taiwan, and whether
the government should negotiate with Beijing for the establishment of

Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday
she is not surprised that Beijing has refrained from trying to

lobbing missiles into the sea near the island in 1996, and trying to
intimidate the country again prior to the 2000 election. But, she
said, the mainland has no hold over Taiwan.

Although Beijing has not repeated its fruitless efforts this

LEGISLATIVE YUAN TO DELIBERATE PROPOSAL TO CUT LEGISLATURE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan is slated Friday to
deliberate a proposal to halve the number of legislative seats, but
although both the ruling and the major opposition parties have
promised to support the idea, an alliance of independent lawmakers
has insisted on reopening negotiations between the various parties,
thereby casting the passage of the proposal into doubt.
</P>
<P>
The alliance of a dozen lawmakers claimed that the proposal, once
passed, will eliminate the role of independent lawmakers who reflect
the voice of the minorities and the underprivileged and should
therefore be re-negotiated rather than railroaded through the
legislature on the eve of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
According to a regulation in the legislature, a bill should be
referred to negotiations between the various parties if any of the
political factions in the legislature request such a move, and if
consensus is still elusive after four months of negotiation , a
bill may be put to the vote anyway.
</P>
<P>
However, both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition Kuomintang and People First Party have vowed to support
the proposal and they urged their lawmakers to attend Friday's
legislative meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen called on Beijing Thursday to resume the
long-stalled talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait after
the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Tsai made the appeal during a meeting with a group of foreign
reporters visiting Taiwan to cover the election and the accompanying
referendum -- the country's first.
</P>
<P>
The top planner of Taiwan's policies toward mainland China said
she is very happy to see so many overseas reporters in Taiwan to
observe the voting and witness the deepening of the nation's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan is a peace-loving country, Tsai said that the
government and people are determined to safeguard the hard-earned
fruits of the nation's democratization and are willing to help uphold
stability and security in the Asia-Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
She voiced the hope that the Beijing authorities will
pragmatically face the deepening of the island's democracy and accept
a proposal for the establishment of a mechanism to promote long-term
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she seconds statements by several foreign experts
on China issues that the current situation in the Taiwan Strait is
"extremely dangerous, " Tsai said that the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) -led government is fully aware of the possible
consequences of a cross-strait military confrontation, so its
policies toward the mainland are very pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she pointed out, the DPP administration has always
evaluated the possibility of military confrontations and is
sufficiently prepared to deal with any contingencies.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that cross-strait relations are not "extremely
dangerous" but "extremely complicated and thorny, " Tsai said she is
sure that no matter who is elected president, he must face the
challenge of maintaining cross-strait stability.
</P>
<P>
In response to a press query as to whether President Chen
Shui-bian will accept the "one China" principle if he is re-elected,
Tsai said the president declared in 2000 that his administration was
willing to hold talks with Beijing on the issue of a future "one
China." She added that Chen's stance has not changed.
</P>
<P>
As for Beijing's demand that the Taipei authorities must accept
the "one China" principle before cross-strait talks are resumed, Tsai
urged the mainland leadership to think twice and adopt a pragmatic
strategy to improve bilateral relations after the election.
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated that Taiwan is willing to hold talks with
Beijing on any issues under the basic principle of national dignity
and sovereignty.

PRESIDENT URGES FIRST-TIME VOTERS TO CAST BALLOTS IN REFERENDUM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian urged Thursday
those who have reached the age of suffrage for the first time to cast
their ballots in the country's first-ever nationwide referendum to be
held alongside Saturday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who is seeking re-election, made the appeal to the 1.04
million first-time voters, most of whom are college students.
</P>
<P>
"No matter which ticket you vote for in the presidential
election, please be sure to cast your ballots in the referendum on
missile defense and relations with mainland China, " Chen said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the international community will be watching Taiwan's
referendum carefully, Chen said he hopes voters will take part in the
referendum to show the world their determination to safeguard their
homeland and make peace with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
According to the Referendum Act passed last November, the
president is authorized to call a "defensive referendum" when he
deems Taiwan's sovereignty to be under external threat.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the mainland's deployment of 496 missiles aimed at
Taiwan constitutes a national security threat and therefore decided
to hold a referendum to coincide with the presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Opposition presidential contender Lien Chan, chairman of the
Kuomintang, who is running neck-and-neck with Chen, has claimed that
the referendum "illegal and meaningless" and the "pan-blue alliance"
of the KMT and the People First Party is airing advertisements urging
supporters not to vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will ask voters two questions:
</P>
<P>
1. Should mainland China refuse to withdraw the missiles it has
targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce the use of force against
us, would you agree that the government should acquire more advanced
anti-missile weapons to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense
capabilities?
</P>
<P>
2. Would you agree that our government should engage in
negotiation with mainland China on the establishment of a
"peace and stability" framework for cross-strait interaction
in order to build consensus and for the welfare of the people
on both sides?
</P>
<P>
The referendum will be rendered void if fewer than 50 percent of
voters collect a referendum ballot. Picking up a paper ballot
constitutes taking part in the referendum. The referendum is
approved if more than 50 percent of those who take part cast "yes"
votes. A total of 16,497,746 voters are eligible to vote in the
referendum.

POLITICAL DONATION BILL CLEARS LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Political figures will not be allowed to
accept political donations during non-election periods and only those
who intend to run in an election will be able to do so, according to
a political donation bill passed by the Legislative Yuan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, neither political parties, groups, nor election
aspirants can accept political donations without prior approval from
the government, and any approved donations must be paid into special
accounts in financial institutions or the Post Office.
</P>
<P>
The bill also stipulates that there is no ceiling on the total
amount of political donations and that in terms of the period in
which donations can be accepted, a president can accept political
donations one year before his term expires, legislators can accept
donations up to 10 months before their term expires, and elected
mayors, city councilors, magistrates and county councilors can accept
donations up to eight months before their term expires.
</P>
<P>
An individual can donate a maximum of NT$300,000 (US$8,982) ,
while civic groups can donate at most NT$2 million and businesses can
give no more than NT$3 million to the same political party or
political group.
</P>
<P>
The legislative caucuses of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, had proposed that
political parties should not be allowed to donate more than a quarter
of the maximum election campaign fees to an election aspirant.
</P>
<P>
When the proposal was put to the vote, however, it failed to
pass, with 105 against it compared with 91 in favor and one
abstention.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed amid revelations by several figures,
including disgraced former Tuntex Group Chairman Chen You-hao, that
they have made political donations to various political figures,
which sparked debate about the practice.

The Times: The race for No 10 starts here.

Gordon Brown (chancellor of the Exchequer) launched a general
election campaign yesterday by offering a choice between Labour
spending on frontline services, or tax cuts under the Conservatives.

Financial Times: Brown pledges to spend £20bn on public services.

Gordon Brown pledged to wring an extra £20bn a year for public
services with a bold plan to squeeze the government's running costs
and cut more than 40,000 civil service jobs.

In a Budget that was light on tax changes, and set the limits of
Labour's tightest spending review since coming to power in 1997, Mr
Brown seized the initiative with an attack on bureaucracy, telling
government departments to save 2.5 per cent of their budgets each
year through increased efficiency.

<P>
All 15 crew members aboard a
Panama-registered freighter that ran aground off the northern Taiwan
coast Thursday have been rescued, coast guard officials said later
that day.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the cargo ship was transporting 5,500
tons of gravel from mainland China's southeastern port city of Fuzhou
to the Japanese island of Okinawa when it ran aground off Yehliu in
northern Taipei County at around 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Three coast guard patrol ships braved rough seas and high winds
to reach the stricken vessel as soon as the Keelung coast guard
office received a distress call from the grounded freighter
identified as the "Shuntong."
</P>
<P>
All of the crew are mainland Chinese citizens. Tan Dehzhou, the
freighter's captain, said he and his colleagues are all very grateful
for the Taiwan coast guard rescue. Tan said the freighter ran aground
mainly because of a mechanical failure. If the weather conditions
improve, he went on, the vessel is not expected to sink or leak oil
for the time being. "I have informed the shipping firm, which will
handle the case," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Keelung coast guard office said it has assigned patrol ships
to monitor whether there is any oil leakage from the ill-fated
vessel. "We have also prepared contingency measures to prevent any
oil leakage and pollution of nearby waters," he added.

DPP LEGISLATOR COMES FORWARD TO SPEAK ON POLITICAL DONATIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday broke his silence
regarding his alleged role in the political donation case that
prompted the first lady to file a libel suit against a fugitive
tycoon.
</P>
<P>
Shen fell short of saying outright that he was the one who had
accompanied disgraced former Tuntex chairman Chen You-hao on a visit
in 1994 to the wife of Chen Shui-bian to present her with a donation
to help with the mayoral campaign of her husband.
</P>
<P>
With only two days to go before the March 20 presidential
election, Shen said that the focus of the presidential campaign
blurred because of the attention being paid to an event that happened
10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He appealed for a return to normal, saying that both the ruling
and opposition presidential candidates should stage a "high-class"
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Shen made the remarks in a news conference called at the
Legislative Yuan in response to the tycoon-turned-fugitive's
statement in a Sunday news conference held in Los Angeles where Chen
You-hao said that the "DPP heavyweight" he had mentioned earlier was
Shen. Chen You-hao said he and Shen visited Chen Shui-bian's wife
twice at her home and presented her with NT$3 million (US$89,820).
</P>
<P>
Although first lady Wu Shu-chen had denied Chen You-hao's
allegations, Shen said, "My memory of the matter differs from that of
the first lady."
</P>
<P>
Shen had refused to comment on the matter after Chen You-hao's
statement in spite of rumors that his silence was a tacit admission
of his complicity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the question as to whether he went to the first lady's
home or not, Shen said that there were "four possibilities."
</P>
<P>
The first one is that he did in fact visit the first lady, Shen
said, but remained ambiguous by adding, "This is the reasonable
answer that most people would give, although the three other
possibilities cannot be ruled out."
</P>
<P>
The second scenario is that he didn't go, but he thought he did.
The third is that he didn't go, but is deliberately trying to frame
the first lady - a very unlikely scenario, and the fourth is that he
is sick and suffered from delusions.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the most likely scenario is that he did go, and if
he must testify in court, he will go willingly.
</P>
<P>
On the part of the first lady, Shen said the problem is that Wu
simply has no memory of the event. The first lady has already filed a
libel suit at the Taipei Prosecutors' Office over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that regarding the first lady, there are three other
possibilities, one being that Wu has totally forgotten the incident
and would, therefore, pass a polygraph test. The second is that she
maliciously concealed the fact that the visit was made, which is very
unlikely, and the third is that Wu had indeed forgotten but now
remembers but is choosing not to recall the incident out of good
intentions. This last case is something that an average person would
be able to come out and admit, but being the wife of the head of
state, this may be difficult to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen refused to comment on any of the three possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the Tuntex Group was one of the top-10
conglomerates a decade ago, and Chen You-hao's donation was made "out
of respect for the individual, " and the recipient was full of
gratitude. Shen said he was "an innocent bystander, " and can't
understand how the whole thing has turned so vicious during the
presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that his original intention had been to say nothing
about the matter until after the March 20 election, but given the way
the situation had "disappointed" him, he decided to come forward.
</P>
<P>
He said that if he had not come forward, the situation would be
further blown out of proportion with a media circus surrounding him
as if he were running for president.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that he and Chen You-hao are not good friends and are
not in regular contact and that neither Chen You-hao nor anyone else
have "any evidence of illegal dealings" by him, although Chen You-hao
did make " generous political donations" to him during elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reactions of various political parties were mixed
after Shen's news conference.
</P>
<P>
Chiou I-jen, re-election campaign manager for President Chen
Shui-bian, said that the DPP will respect the differences in memory
of Shen and the first lady. As the case is now in court, Wu is
willing to take "a scientific approach" on the different memory
issue.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Hung Chi-chang said that an event that took place
a decade ago should not become the focus of the presidential campaign
today. His legislative colleague, Tsai Huang-lang, said that Shen had
given the voters a lesson on how to return to real issues in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the DPP, said that
Shen's explanation should have a positive effect on the DPP's
election campaign since it will show the difference between the DPP
and the opposition Kuomintang, as the DPP will face the facts.
</P>
<P>
TSU Secretary-General Lin Chi-chia said that Shen's words echoed
those of Lee Yuan-tseh, the president of Academia Sinica and the
nation's only Nobel laureate, who said that the DPP, although lacking
in experience in ruling the country, nevertheless has more momentum
to move forward than the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).
</P>
<P>
The KMT said that it had no comment on Shen's statement, saying
that the KMT and its ally, the People First Party, will not interfere
with the matter between President Chen, Legislator Shen and Chen
You-hao.

PRESIDENT CHEN KEEPS PITCHING FOR REFERENDUM IN ONLINE NEWSPAPER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said in his
weekly online newspaper Thursday that the March 20 referendum is
significant for history, democracy, peace and uniting the country.
</P>
<P>
With only two days to go before the country's first nationwide
referendum called by Chen, the president said the referendum is an
inherent part of democracy, and there have been more than 1,500
referendums organized by 156 countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Recounting the country's many milestones in its development of
democracy ever since the lifting of martial law in 1987 -- such as
the lifting of the ban on launching new newspapers, abolishing of ban
on the formation of new political parties, the complete election of
members to the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, the popular
election of the president and the transfer of power between different
parties, the president said the March 20 referendum will consummate
the country's democratic development.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the referendum will send a message to the world that the
country desire peace and will not bow to military threats.
</P>
<P>
It will also put the island in the international spotlight, and
put the country on the world's political map.
</P>
<P>
He urged his countrymen be sure to cast their ballots in the
referendum. "March 20 will go down in history not because of the
presidential election, but because of the referendum of which the
effects will be felt by our offspring forever," he said.

MOTION AGAINST HASTY LEGISLATIVE REFORMS MIGHT BE SUBMITTED FRIDAY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  18  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislator Chen Shei-saint of the
opposition Kuomintang said Thursday that he might come up with a
motion this Friday to demand that a draft constitutional revision
bill to halve the current 225 seats in the Legislative Yuan be
referred once again to joint negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The proposal will be submitted if the numbers of the "pan-blue
alliance" and the "pan-green" camp legislators that have endorsed the
motion are equal, Chen said during a meeting with local reporters.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the motion had been endorsed by more than 30
lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including two of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) . He added that DPP senior
Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung supports his concept but hasn't signed the
motion yet.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed discontent at legislative caucus whips of the
ruling and opposition parties for having prohibited their party
lawmakers from endorsing the proposal, claiming that it is
unreasonable for them to do so as they also understand that relevant
matching measures are indispensable for the implementation of
legislative reforms.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said that he will seek to drum up support from Shen
and other legislators of the "pan-green camp" that refers to the DPP
and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union. Only when the "pan-blue
alliance" and the "pan-green" camp lawmakers signing the motion are
equal in numbers, will he not be branded as an "anti-reformist" while
submitting the proposal, Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
Hours after various political factions in the Legislative Yuan
agreed to amend the Republic of China Constitution before the March
20 presidential election to reduce by half the number of legislators,
several opposition lawmakers said that they support legislative
reforms but worry that if it is done in haste, more problems will be
created than are solved.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan's Committee of Constitutional Amendment
passed the first reading of three draft constitutional revision bills
on legislative reforms last week, under which the current 225 seats
in the legislature will be cut to 113 starting from 2008, the current
electoral system will be changed to a "single seat, two votes" system
-- meaning one vote for an individual candidate and another vote for
a political party in each constituency -- and legislators' terms will
be extended to four years from the current three years.
</P>
<P>
The legislature is scheduled to deal with the three draft bills
during a plenary session this Friday in response to the public's
repeated calls for upgrading the legislature's efficiency and
quality.
</P>
<P>
According to deliberative rules of the Legislative Yuan, when any
legislative caucus or legislator comes up with a motion against a
draft bill that will be put to a second reading, the draft bill will
be referred directly to joint negotiations and will be submitted to a
plenary session for handling if no results are obtained within four
months.

2004 TAIPEI INTERNATIONAL PLASTICS AND RUBBER INDUSTRY SHOW OPENS

<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2004 Taipei International Plastics and
Rubber Industry Show opened Thursday at the Taiwan World Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
A total of 344 companies from around the world are showing their
products at 1,818 booths during the four-day event, said a spokesman
for the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), which is
jointly sponsoring the fair with the Taiwan Association of Machinery
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Well-known world-class companies, such as Toshiba, Matsui and Shi
Plastics from Japan and those from the France, Italy, the United
States and South Korea, are also participating in the show.
</P>
<P>
The biennial show, the largest of its kind in Asia, provides good
access for buyers of plastics and rubber processing machinery,
engineering components and auxiliary components in the plastics and
rubber machinery trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the TAITRA official, the domestic industry is an
important export business for the country. Following the developments
over the past 30 years, the industry's exports last year set a new
high of US$768 million, he said, adding that its export value will
continue to grow this year out of keen demand from foreign markets.

TAIWAN POPULAR AMONG OVERSEAS FILIPINO WORKERS: ROC ENVOY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Manila,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Emerson Lin and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan is a popular choice among the many
Filipino workers wishing to work overseas, due to a handsome salary,
geographic proximity, political stability and a democratic
environment, according to the Republic of China Representative to the
Philippines Wu Shin-hsing.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks in a recent program recorded on the OFW Hour,
a program produced by the RPN TV station, during an interview in
which Wu spoke about the lives of Filipino workers in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Citing ROC government statistics, Wu said there were a total of
81,895 Filipino workers in Taiwan as of the end of January, with 34
percent of them serving as caregivers, 63 percent working in the
manufacturing sector and the remaining 3 percent employed as maids
and construction workers.
</P>
<P>
Some 71 percent of the Filipino workers in Taiwan, or 58,192
people, are women, and the laborers from the Philippines form the
second-largest group of foreign workers in Taiwan only after the
103,000 Thai workers, he further pointed out.
</P>
<P>
When asked why many returning Philippine workers would like to
work in Taiwan again, Wu said it was because of the good pay, the
closeness of the two countries, the political stability, and Taiwan's
democracy and legal protection.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu pointed out that the ROC government might adjust the
number of foreign workers imported to Taiwan depending on its
economic situation. Alien workers will be allowed mainly in to
Taiwan's manufacturing, construction, and fishery sectors, or to
serve as domestic maids and caregivers in the coming few years.

TSU HAILS PASSAGE OF POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS ACT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) hailed
the passage of the much-anticipated Political Contributions Act
Thursday, saying the legislation marks a step forward in the
establishment of clean politics.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the passage of the new act as it is long overdue, "
said TSU legislative whip Chen Chien-ming.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen said he feels regret that the act fails to
regulate political party assets due to a deliberate dodge and boycott
by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that the KMT's huge party assets have hindered fair
competition among domestic political parties. To remedy this
deficiency, he said, the TSU, a pro-Taiwan ally of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will push for the early passage of
other "sunshine bills, " including the political party bill and the
legislative lobby bill.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the political party bill must prohibit all local
parties from operating profit-making businesses to ensure
fair inter-party competition. He also urged the KMT to return all of
its ill-gotten assets to the national coffers to substantiate its vow
to push for clean politics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling DPP legislative caucus said it is
regrettable that the newly passed Political Contributions Act fails
to restrict political parties from donating funds to those who intend
to run for public office.
</P>
<P>
"While we are happy to see that our long-term efforts to push
this legislation has finally borne fruit, we feel regret that the act
fails to impose a ceiling on political parties' financial
contributions to individual candidates, " said DPP Legislator Chao
Yung-ching.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the KMT, one of the world's wealthiest parties, has
traditionally granted huge funds to its candidates, Chao said the
absence of a ceiling on donations from political parties has created
a loophole in the new act.
</P>
<P>
"This sunshine law fails to shed light on political party funds.
I'm worried that this may lead to grave consequences," Chao said.
</P>
<P>
During the second reading of the bill at Thursday's legislative
session, the DPP proposed to add a clause to the bill stipulating
that political party contributions should not exceed 25 percent of
individual candidates' total campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
The proposal failed to clear the legislative floor due to the
opposition of the "pan-blue alliance" which controls a majority in
the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
KMT legislative whip Liao Feng-teh said the DPP-proposed
restriction violated the principle of party politics. "It's
unreasonable to restrict political parties from donating funds to
individual candidates," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
PFP Legislator Lee Yung-ping echoed Liao's views, saying that
restrictions on political parties' donations to individual candidates
will encourage hopefuls to forge ties with business groups. "Such
practices could lead to favoritism and corrupt deals," Lee claimed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liao said the KMT will put all of its profit-making
businesses into a "blind trust" in the near future.
</P>
<P>
To show its commitment to establishing clean politics, Liao said
the KMT had thrown support behind a DPP-proposed amendment to the
Political Contributions Act which bans political party-owned
enterprises from donating funds to political parties, political
groups and individual candidates.

TO prevent President Arroyo from using government

<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged all local
citizens Friday to calm down and support the government after
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu were shot
while on the campaign trail in southern Taiwan ahead of Saturday's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the appeal after presiding over a meeting of the National
Security Council on behalf of President Chen.
</P>
<P>
While campaigning in the southern city of Tainan in the
afternoon, Chen was grazed in the stomach and Lu was hit in the right
knee.
</P>
<P>
"Their injuries were not life threatening," Yu said, adding that
local people need not be panicked. "President Chen still can
direct national affairs and the administration is operating
normally."
</P>
<P>
Yu said the Central Election Commission has announced that the
presidential election and the nation's first-ever referendum will be
held Saturday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The premier further said the national security mechanism has been
activated to maintain law and order and social stability in the wake
of the unprecedented shooting incident. The MInistry of Foreign
Affairs has also briefed foreign envoys stationed in Taiwan on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
This marked the first time that an ROC president has been shot.
Yu said he feels deep regret over the incident. He said the National
Police Administration under the Ministry of the Interior has formed a
special task force to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do every possible effort to bring to justice all those who
were involved in the shooting incident," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who
concurrently serves as the campaign manager of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance's" presidential candidate Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan, said he believes the people of Taiwan will be able to weather
through this crisis smoothly.
</P>
<P>
As to whether the incident will have any impact on the
presidential poll, Wang said it remains unclear. He would not go
into details.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui, who has been campaigning hard for
President Chen's re-election bid, was reportedly in tears after
hearing of the shooting incident. Taiwan Solidarity Union
President Huang Chu-wen quoted Lee as having called on local people
to remain calm and rational at this moment.
</P>
<P>
About five hours after the shooting, the president left the
hospital to return to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Lu were riding in a red convertible four-wheel-drive
vehicle and waving to crowds lining the streets in Tainan when
shots were fired into their motorcade. People were setting off
celebratory fireworks as he drove by and early media reports said he
was injured by firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
Doctors showed pictures of an 11-centimeter-long wound just under
Chen's navel. Chan Chi-hsien, head of Chi Mei Hospital in Tainan where
Chen was treated, said there was no injury to internal organs.
</P>
<P>
The bullet grazed the vice president's right knee, leaving a
wound about two centimeters, he said, adding that the bullet caused
no bone fractures and it wasn't found.

Tainan City, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Yu told a news conference after the meeting that President Chen
is now fine after being treated at a Tainan hospital and is fully
capable of carrying out his job as head of the state.
</P>
<P>
Yu said Chen called him from the hospital after the incident and
asked him to chair the meeting of the National Security Council. Chen
also called his chief of staff, Chiou I-jen, and asked him to inform
the presidents of the other four Yuans about the incident, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is difficult for the president's bodyguards to
keep Chen safe from an assailant during a campaign parade like the
one where the president was riding in an open car with bystanders
setting off fireworks along the roadside.

LEGISLATURE DOWNSIZING PROPOSAL TO BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER DISCUSSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan failed to pass a
constitutional amendment bill to halve the number of legislative
seats from 2008 Friday as scheduled, due to an opposition from
independent lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The legislature was originally scheduled to complete second and
third readings of the much-anticipated constitutional amendment bill
at its last plenary session ahead of Saturday's presidential election
to pave the way for legislative downsizing.
</P>
<P>
However, an alliance of independent lawmakers came up with a
motion demanding that the constitutional amendment bill be further
discussed to mend what it calls some deficiencies in the draft bill.
</P>
<P>
According to the legislature's operational rules, a bill should
be referred to negotiations among the various parties if any of the
political factions in the legislature request such a move. If
consensus is still elusive after four months of negotiation, a bill
could be put to the vote anyway.
</P>
<P>
In response to the independent lawmakers' request, Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng then announced that the constitutional
amendment bill should be subject to further inter-party consultations
before a second reading can be held. He also ordered the two largest
parties in the legislature -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- to jointly organize a
consultative session on the bill within four months.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus blamed the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) for the failure
to pass the constitutional amendment bill before the presidential
poll. The "pan-blue alliance" controls a majority in the 225-seat
legislature.
</P>
<P>
"We feel regret that the 'pan-blue alliance' failed to honor its
promise to pass the constitutional amendment bill regarding
legislative seats reduction before the presidential poll as the first
step toward legislative reform, " said DPP legislative whip Tsai
Huang-lang.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitutional amendment bill that passed the
first reading last week, the number of legislative seats will be cut
to 113 from the current 225 from the seventh-term legislature to be
elected in 2008, and the legislative tenure will be extended to four
years from the current three years. According to the bill, there
should be at least 34 women legislators and the number of at-large
legislators should be set at 34.

<P>
Two prosecutors were assigned to
investigate the shootings of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu Friday, Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan said
in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The two prosecutors will lead a group of investigators from the
Tainan branch of the Investigation Bureau and police officers to
collect evidence in the case, Chen said
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place at 1:45 p.m. when Chen and Lu were riding
in an open jeep parading the streets of Taiwan's Tainan City, in a
last-ditch effort to get more votes before Saturday's presidential
election. Their supporters lined the streets to greet him, with many
of them setting off firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
As the motorcade cruised along Wenhsien Road, the president felt
pain in his stomach and Lu, who was standing by his side, felt a pain
in her knee.
</P>
<P>
A doctor from the president's medical team found that the
president was wounded and bleeding, whereupon the president's car
rushed to nearby Chi Mei Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the hospital found an 11 cm long, 2 cm wide wound on
Chen's stomach below the navel and a metal object that they described
as looking like a bullet. Fortunately the object did not penetrate
his abdominal cavity.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the wound was sewn up after being cleaned and
sterilized. Chen was admitted to the intensive care ward for
observation, although his condition was described as stable and his
ability to govern was not impaired.
</P>
<P>
Lu suffered an injury to her knee but was otherwise unscathed.
</P>
<P>
The incident stunned the country, which is absorbed in a fierce
presidential election pitting Chen against opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, government officials gathered in an emergency meeting
and Chen's chief of staff, saying at a news conference that the
national security mechanism was activated after the incident, urged
the public to calm down.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun promised to track down the assailant or
assailants.
</P>
<P>
Central Election Commission Chairman Huang Shih-cheng said
Saturday's ballot-casting will continue as scheduled, but both Chen's
Democratic Progressive Party and Lien's KMT announced a halt to the
rest of the day's campaign activities, which were supposed to
culminate their respective campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Anxious supporters of Chen immediately crowded into the Chi Mei
Medical Center to await any news about Chen's condition.
</P>
<P>
In Taipei, thousands of Chen supporters gathered at his national
campaign headquarters, singing their campaign song to show their
solidarity with the president.
</P>
<P>
A local television station reported later in the evening that
police had found two empty cartridges near the site of the shooting.

JAPAN URGED TO MAKE TAIWAN STRATEGIC PARTNER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japan should give deeper thought to its
relations with mainland China and should make Taiwan an important
strategic partner of Japan, a world renowned Japanese sociologist has
said.
</P>
<P>
Mineo Nakajima, former president of the Tokyo University of
Foreign Studies, was quoted by the Sankei Shimbun newspaper Friday as
saying that although the People's Republic of China has continued to
adhere to its "one China" policy, the PRC has not ruled Taiwan for a
single day.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima, also a famed political commentator in Japan, said
during a speech Thursday that Japan and Taiwan are virtually "one
body of esprit de corps " and that if Taiwan were annexed by the
mainland, it would definitely result in major damage to Japan's
interests.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the mainland is not a "trustworthy" opponent,
Nakajima said Beijing's increase of its defense budget by a whopping
11 percent is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
He called for the Japanese government, as well as the Japanese
private sector, not to be fooled by the mainland's "false impression
of success, " including its scheduled hosting of the Olympic Games in
2008 and the mammoth Three Gorges dam on the Yangze River.
</P>
<P>
He added that the mainland's freewheeling economy has now
encountered a bottleneck and that the country will face an economic
bubble sooner or later.

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Police Administration (NPA)
inaugurated Friday a cyber national united law enforcement command
headquarters, which is designed to allow the NPA authorities to be in
full control of public order islandwide before, during and after
Saturday's presidential election and referendum.
</P>
<P>
NPA Director-General Chang Si-liang presided over a meeting at
the NPA headquarters Friday on nationwide law enforcement
preparedness during the crucial election days, and on the possible
impact on the country's law and order caused by the election and
referendum.
</P>
<P>
Chang talked via teleconference with authorities from police
headquarters scattered throughout Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Yunlin, Chiayi
counties and Kaohsiung City in Taiwan proper, as well as the outlying
counties of Kinmen and Lienchiang to gain a better understanding of
the public order situation in those areas on the eve of the election.
</P>
<P>
He instructed police authorities around the nation to prepare
themselves for any contingencies in the event of scuffles or
post-election riots.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the cyber national united law enforcement command
headquarters will oversee public order nationwide in real time in
three areas: public security, transportation and communications and
supervisory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officers from the NPA's public security division said
that in light of reports that international terrorists have included
Taiwan as a target, the NPA has heightened surveillance nationwide,
particularly in public places where people tend to converge.
</P>
<P>
Stepped-up surveillance attention will also be paid at public
transportation systems, infrastructure systems, airports and
seaports, NPA officials said.

<P>
Overseas Taiwanese residing in
America boarded the last batch of flights from Los Angeles to Taipei
Thursday to return to Taiwan in time for Saturday's presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
From Thursday afternoon to evening, all flights bound for Taiwan
were filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
One passenger who arrived in Los Angeles on his way back to
Taiwan from Argentina, said that he could not return earlier to
campaign for his favorite presidential candidate because of his job,
but he said he will not miss the chance to vote and took a three-day
leave just to return to vote.
</P>
<P>
Another passenger making the trip, who resides in the state of
Missouri, said that he had only had a toothbrush and a two-day change
of clothes with him.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the China Airlines and EVA Airways counters at the Los
Angeles airport reported that passengers returning to Taiwan to vote
over the past few days have far outnumbered those who returned four
years ago, showing that the zest of overseas Taiwanese in the
election is far greater this time than it was in 2000.

<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that the
government will do everything possible to coordinate with a local
television station that had earlier said it will conduct exit polls
on Saturday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio interview, Yu said that although there is no
law prohibiting the conducting of exit polls, the Executive Yuan is
worried about the possibility of "incidents" erupting between the
unveiling of exit polls and the formal announcement of the election
results.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that exit polls have never been conducted in Taiwan
before and that there is no law prohibiting them. The problem, he
went on, is that this is a bitterly contested election and the
government has to take a lot factors into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that an earlier decision by the Central Election
Commission (CEC) to count as valid any presidential ballots miscast
in the referendum ballot boxes and vice versa has triggered concern
that incidents could erupt between the opening of the ballots and the
formal announcement of the election results.
</P>
<P>
The CEC later reversed its decision to allow an earlier
announcement of the presidential result.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that if the cable television station unveils its
exit poll right after the polling stations close at 4 p.m Saturday,
then there will be still two to three hours before the formal
announcement of the election result, and the administration is
worried that there could be disturbances during this period.

ESTABLISHING NATIONAL IDENTITY  HISTORIC MISSION: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Friday
that his "historic mission and obligation" as the nation's leader is
to establish the identity of Taiwan as a national leader.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN aired Friday morning, Chen said he is
happy that support for a separate Taiwanese identify has increased
over the years.
</P>
<P>
On relations with mainland China, Chen said that Taiwan has to
establish its national identity, including the independence of its
economy, which he said is very important.
</P>
<P>
If Taiwan loses its national identity, it will reach a dead end
and there will be no future cross-strait relations and no respect for
the will and choice of the 23 million people of Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the status quo of Taiwan is a historic
evolution and that his past statements on the country's status have
simply been telling the facts without changing them.
</P>
<P>
More specifically, he said, Taiwan's relationship with China is a
"state to state" one.
</P>
<P>
On concern by the United States over Saturday's referendum -- the
first nationwide referendum in Taiwan -- Chen said that Taiwan has
continued to watch the views of the U.S. government and the feelings
of the U.S. people while promoting democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said that relations between Taiwan and the United States are
definitely one of democratic allies and added that Taiwan will not
become a liability of the United States but an asset.

SNUB TO REFERENDUM WOULD HURT CONSENSUS-BUILDING: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A snub to Taiwan's first-ever nationwide
referendum to be held alongside Saturday's presidential election will
hinder the establishment of a consensus-building system in Taiwan, a
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference, MAC Vice Chairman Chen
Ming-tong said that if the historic referendum is rendered void
because more than 50 percent of eligible voters refuse to take part,
it will hurt Taiwan's consensus-building through referendum.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, Chen said, the result could cause a setback in the
development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.
</P>
<P>
"Mainland China will interpret the invalid referendum as evidence
of the Taiwan people's lack of consensus on national defense and on
the development of cross-strait ties, " Chen explained, adding that
the scenario will give room for Beijing to drive a wedge between the
Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen went on, a null referendum will give the
international community the impression that the people of Taiwan are
divided. "Should that be the case, foreign friends' support for our
cause may decrease," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Referendum Act passed last November, the
president is authorized to call a "defensive referendum" when he
deems Taiwan's sovereignty to be under external threat.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said after the passage of the Referendum
Act that mainland China's deployment of 496 missiles aimed at Taiwan
constitutes a national security threat and therefore decided to hold
a referendum to coincide with the March 20 presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Opposition presidential contender Lien Chan, chairman of the
Kuomintang, who is challenging Chen's re-election bid, has claimed
that the referendum is "illegal and meaningless" and the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party is airing
advertisements urging supporters not to vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will ask voters two questions:
</P>
<P>
1. Should mainland China refuse to withdraw the missiles it has
targeted at Taiwan and openly renounce the use of force against
us, would you agree that the government should acquire more advanced
anti-missile weapons to strengthen Taiwan's self-defense
capabilities?
</P>
<P>
2. Would you agree that our government should engage in
negotiation with mainland China on the establishment of a
"peace and stability" framework for cross-strait interaction
in order to build consensus and for the welfare of the people
on both sides?
</P>
<P>
The referendum will be rendered null and void if fewer than 50
percent of voters collect a referendum ballot. Picking up a paper
ballot constitutes taking part in the referendum. The referendum is
approved if more than 50 percent of those who take part cast "yes"
votes.
</P>
<P>
During Friday's news conference, MAC Vice Chairman Chen was asked
if the referendum is valid, but more than half the voters cast "no"
votes, how the government will react.
</P>
<P>
Chen said since a negative reply is also a form of opinion,
such a referendum result will be "binding."
</P>
<P>
"The government will certainly respect the outcome," he claimed.

PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI-BIAN WINS RE-ELECTION WITH TENACITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

CNA staff
</P>
<P>
Taipei, March 20 (CNA) President Chen Shui-bian has won his
re-election bid with tenacity in an uphill battle which saw him close
a wide gap and then win by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
Chen, after casting his vote at a polling station in Taipei under
increased protection Saturday morning after being shot by an unknown
assailant the previous day on the campaign trail, assured the public
that he was well, adding that, "even if a bullet knocked me down, it
will not defeat the will of the 23 million people on Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Chen showed the same tenacity throughout the presidential
campaign, although the shooting which took place one day prior to the
election may have also played a certain role in the closest-ever
presidential election in Taiwan's history.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the polls showed that his rival, Lien Chan,
chairman of the Kuomintang, held a slim lead over the president. By
election day, however, the race was neck and neck according to polls,
which by law were closed 10 days prior to the March 20 election.
</P>
<P>
The election campaign featured one of the nasty war of words in
Taiwan's history, with the public bombarded with daily accusations
traded between rival parties and an ever-increasing volume of
vote-buying with promises to entice voters.
</P>
<P>
Chen's opponents wanted the voters to focus on the lackluster
performance in the nation's economy, believing it was the president's
Achilles' heel, but Chen successfully maneuvered the campaign theme
to focus on Taiwan's first nationwide referendum held alongside the
presidential election prior to Saturday's election.
</P>
<P>
The referendum vote on increased national defense and the opening
of cross-strait talks raised the concern of Taiwan's strongest
supporter, the United States, as well as Japan and the European
Union, but the president held fast to the planned vote.
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 28, or the nation's Peace Day, supporters of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party successfully mobilized more than one
million to hold a mammoth "hand-in-hand" human chain along the
island to show its opposition to the nearly 500 missiles deployed by
mainland China against Taiwan, giving a big boost to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
The rival "pan-blue" camp countered by staging big rallies in
southern, central and southern Taiwan, which claimed attendance of
two million, on March 13.
</P>
<P>
President Chen, who was elected in 2000 in a five-way race with
only 39.3 percent of the vote, with his two major rivals James Soong
trailing behind and Lien Chan finishing a distant third, pulled in
50.12 percent of the votes in the two-candidate contest this time.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who used to claim that he was blocked by his opponents in
implementing his policies, should now have more leeway with a greater
mandate from its people.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu won
re-election with 6,471,970, versus, 6,442,452 for Lien Chan and James
Soong, the final tallies of the CEC showed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,252,490 votes were cast in the election out of a
total number of 16,507,179 qualified voters, which represents a
turnout of 80.2 percent.

In addition to expressing his congratulations to President Chen
Shui-bian's re-election success, Uni-President Group Chairman Kao
Chin-yen called on the public to respect the results of the election
and to return to normal life as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan is just a small island that lacks natural
resources, Kao said all walks of life, regardless of their ethnicity
and political affiliation, now must be reunited to face up to the
challenges ahead from across the world.
</P>
<P>
Kao also called on the future leaders to wholeheartedly serve the
Taiwan people by building a clean and efficient government to make
the country a strong competitor in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that global economies have showed noticeable signs
of recovery, Kao contended that the weighed index of the domestic
stock market should be able to rebound to the level of 7,500 points.
He called for the opening of direct transport, trade and postal links
with mainland China and appealed for an unfettered investment
climate.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Sheng-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers Association, also called for public respect
for the outcome of the presidential poll and urged the government to
fully assume its responsibility to take care of the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Hsu voiced his hope for a more proficient and more active
administration and appealed for a returning to normal life and
operations, now that the emotional race has ended. Economy is the key
issue now, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the final results made public by the Central
Election Commission, Chen won over Lien Chan -- Kuomintang chairman
and Chen's sole rival in the presidential election -- by a slim
margin. Chen earned 6,471,970 votes, while Lien gained 6,442,452

OPPOSITION PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE REFUSES TO CONCEDE DEFEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance's"
presidential candidate announced Saturday that he will file a lawsuit
to declare the just-concluded presidential election invalid because
he felt it was unfair.
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan made the announcement after
learning that he trailed President Chen Shui-bian by a razor-thin
margin.
</P>
<P>
Addressing huge crowds of supporters converging at his campaign
headquarters, Lien first called on his supporters to remain calm and
rational.
</P>
<P>
He then claimed that the just-concluded presidential election was
unfair. "If we stay silent, I don't know how we or our generation
could face up to history, to the democratic system, our forefathers
and offspring," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lien demanded that the Central Election Commission (CEC) seal all
ballot boxes in the 13,000 polling booths around the country so that
a recount can be done.
</P>
<P>
Lien also said that the shooting of the president and vice
president on the eve of the presidential poll was suspicious and that
its influence on the vote should be investigated.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Lien's running mate People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong said Saturday he supported
Lien's decision to seek to annul the results of the just-concluded
presidential election through legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
Soong said he agreed with Lien's contention that the election was
shrouded in "a cloud of questions." He alleged that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party had been manipulating the election from
the very beginning, which damaged the fairness of the vote.
</P>
<P>
He said democracy is the country's best weapon against Communist
China, and if the election was not conducted fairly, Taiwan has lost
its weapon to fight communism.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the vote, gunfire hit President Chen Shui-bian in
the abdomen and Vice President Annette Lu in the knee as they rode
through the southern city of Tainan, waving to supporters from an
open-top Jeep. Both of them were discharged from the hospital with
minor injuries hours after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election and Recall Law, the "pan-blue alliance"
of the KMT and the People First Party must file the "invalid
election" lawsuit with the Taiwan High Court and the High
Administrative Court within 15 days after the CEC formally announces
the winning ticket on March 26.

HONG KONG LAUNCHES DRIVE TO ATTRACT TAIWAN TOURISTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hong Kong tourist authorities are
launching drives to lure Taiwan tourists in an effort to entice more
visitors from Taiwan, which has long been one of the territory's
tourist sources.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the
first half of last year, the number of Taiwan tourists heading to
Hong Kong has dropped noticeably recently at a time when many Taiwan
people have put off their overseas trips out of a grave concerns over
the hotly contested presidential election on March 20.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Taiwan
people paid a total of 2.42 million visits to Hong Kong in 2002, but
the number dropped to about 1.85 million in 2003. He added that the
bureau hopes to attract at least 2.4 million visitors from Taiwan for
Hong Kong this year.
</P>
<P>
Mainland China now is Hong Kong's largest source of tourists,
with more than one million visitors coming each month, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It means that some 200,000 Taiwan people traveled to mainland
China's special administrative region per month in the past, but
statistics show that because of this year's presidential race in
Taiwan, the number dropped to some 140,000 in January this year.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to forge a romantic image for Hong Kong, the bureau
also sponsored an online activity inviting the public to choice the
top 10 spots most popular in the territory during the period from
Dec. 30 last year to Jan. 30, which attracted a total of 17,697
people to take part, including a large number of participants from
Taiwan, the spokesman said.

2004 POLL SETS STANDARD FOR ADMINISTRATIVE NEUTRALITY: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen
said Saturday that the 2004 presidential election has set a standard
for administrative neutrality for civil servants.
</P>
<P>
During the previous Kuomintang (KMT) administration, Yao claimed
that government agencies often used public resources to campaign for
party candidates and that individual civil servants also frequently
canvassed votes for KMT candidates during office hours.
</P>
<P>
Since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidency
in 2000 in Taiwan's first-ever transition of power between different
political parties, Yao said, the DPP administration has spared no
efforts to push for administrative reform, with priority being given
to administrative neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the presidential campaign over the past year, Yao
said, the government has not used national resources to finance the
DPP presidential ticket's campaign programs. Moreover, he said, all
civil servants have refrained from campaigning for party candidates
during office hours.
</P>
<P>
"This marks an encouraging progress in administrative reform, "
Yao said, adding that the Examination Yuan, which is responsible for
the nation's civil service system, will continue to push for
administrative neutrality and other reforms to upgrade administrative
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The Examination Yuan oversees civil serviants' examination;
qualification screening, security of tenure, pecuniary aid in case of
death, retirement and other relevant affairs.

PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE SAYS CHI MEI APPROPRIATE FOR EMERGENCY TREATMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
A Presidential Office spokesman on
Saturday refuted the allegation by an independent legislator that the
president and vice president were not taken to the right hospital
after an assassination attempt Friday.
</P>
<P>
James Huang, director of the Department of Public Affairs at the
Presidential Office, said remarks made by Sisy Chen had twisted the
facts and he condemned her of trying to manipulate the news media on
the day of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Sisy Chen faxed a statement to news media Saturday, alleging that
the National Security Bureau was not telling the truth about an
attempted assassination against President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
The president and Lu were canvassing in Tainan City, southern
Taiwan, Friday, the last day before Saturday's presidential election,
when they were hit by gunfire and sustained injuries. Both checked
out of Chi Mei Medical Center in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen, questioning the attack, said Saturday in her fax
to news media that according to the "Hsiang Tai (peace) project, "
initiated to protect the safety of the president in case of
emergency, the designated hospital in Tainan should have been
National Cheng Kung University Medical Center in Tainan City, not Chi
Mei Medical Center in Tainan County.
</P>
<P>
In a hastily called news conference, Huang produced the telephone
numbers of all hospitals listed in the project, as well as other
information to refute Legislator Chen's allegation.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that Legislator Chen's statement on election day was
an attempt to manipulate the news to serve her political purpose, and
he said that her comments were not even newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
Huang stressed that Legislator Chen's list provided to the news
media only included hospitals that are able to handle the landing of
helicopters, and that the number of hospitals and medical
institutions included in the special project to protect the president
is about 250, not just the 20 as listed in Legislator Chen's list.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said that Legislator Chen's statement showed that she is
"full of hatred, " which inspired her to imply that the attack on the
president and vice president was a deliberate, orchestrated incident
to create social disturbance.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Bureau told the public in a late Friday
news conference how it handled the attack on the president.
</P>
<P>
Chen Tsai-fu, head of the president's security guards, said that
the shooting took place at 1:45 p.m., and that the president was sent
to Chi Mei Medical Center at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Regarding questions why the injured president and vice president
were not sent to the nearest hospital -- National Cheng Kung
University Medial Center -- Chen Tsai-fu said that Chi Mei is also
included in the Hsiang Tai project, and that the motorcade of the
president took only four minutes to reach Chi Mei Medical Center.

following the incident, and Operation Chang Shun, including increased

The NSB chief said that all relevant government authorities moved
swiftly to tackle the situation after receiving news of the
assassination attempt, adding that the nation's intelligence agents
will do their utmost to protect the security of the president and
vice president.

Pointing out that President Chen remained fully conscious during
the operation to stitch up his wound at the Chi Mei Medical Center in
Tainan County, Tsai stressed that Chen's ability to rule has not been
affected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a reward of NT$10 million (about US$300,000) has been
offered for any information leading to the arrest of the assailant or
assailants.

president have instructed the ministry to pass on their thanks to all
foreign government leaders and friends for their expressions of
concern and sympathy following Friday's assassination attempt.

Ever since the news of the assassination attempt against

INVESTIGATORS URGED TO SOLVE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT CASE AGAINST CHEN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun has directed the
special investigative task force investigating Friday's assassination
attempt against President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette
Lu to solve the case as soon as possible, Cabinet spokesman Lin
Chia-lung said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and Vice President Lu were both shot and wounded
while their motorcade was driving through the southern Taiwan city of
Tainan Friday afternoon. Chen was hit in the abdomen, while Lu was
grazed in the knee, but their injuries weren't life threatening.
</P>
<P>
Despite the shooting incident, the nation's third direct
presidential election and first-ever referendum were held Saturday as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Lin said Yu was satisfied with the smooth proceeding of the
election and referendum. "The premier has ordered the investigative
task force to solve the riddles surrounding Friday's shooting case as
soon as possible to stem speculation and allay public misgivings, "
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities have ruled out involvement by
mainland China in the assassination attempt, with Tainan prosecutor
Wang Sen-jung telling a news conference held early Saturday that the
shooting "is purely a criminal case"
</P>
<P>
Police haven't announced the arrest of any suspects. However,
there was no early evidence that the shooting involved a conspiracy
or mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said police found two bullets that seemed to match the two
shells found by passersby in the street close to the alleged scene of
the attack.
</P>
<P>
At first, investigators said they only found the bullet that
grazed the president's stomach and ended up in the lining of his
jacket. "It was only after the president had returned to Taipei that
we searched his vehicle and found the other bullet on the floor, "
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
A criminal investigator said judging from the characteristics of
the bullets and the shells, they could belong together, but he added
that further testing is needed before a definitive conclusion can be
reached.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Criminal Investigation Bureau
Director Hou You-yi said it was still too early to say much about the
trajectory of the bullets.
</P>
<P>
"The direction of the bullet (which hit Chen) was from right to
left, but we need more testing to determine the exact trajectory of
the bullets," Hou said.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian, surrounded by
security guards armed with automatic weapons, cast his ballots in the
presidential poll and the landmark referendum Saturday, a day after
he was shot in the abdomen in an assassination attempt on the
campaign trail in the southern city of Tainan.
</P>
<P>
Chen, wearing a cream-colored jacket, pink tie and dark trousers,
walked slowly as he waved to crowds of cheering supporters before he
entered a polling station in a school in an eastern Taipei district.
</P>
<P>
The president was accompanied by his wheelchair-bound wife as
well as their son and daughter while arriving at the polling station.
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech delivered after casting his ballots, Chen
expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the concern shown by all his
fellow compatriots as well as foreign government officials and
friends.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said he feels lucky to have survived the
assassination attempt so that he could vote in the nation's
first-ever referendum, which he described as an important step in
deepening Taiwan's young democracy and showing the world Taiwan's
determination to safeguard its security and make peace with mainland
China.
</P>
<P>
Both Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were shot Friday
afternoon while leading a motorcade in Tainan to canvass support for
their re-election bid on the eve of the election. While Chen's
abdomen was grazed by a bullet, Lu sustained minor injuries to her
right knee.
</P>
<P>
Lu returned to her hometown in Taoyuan County, some 40 kilometers
south of Taipei, at around noon to vote in the presidential poll and
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The vice president was in good spirits and all smiles when she
appeared at the polling station to cast her ballots. Lu said she was
glad to see the election and the referendum proceed smoothly as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the shooting incident, all of our compatriots have
remained calm and rational, " Lu said, adding that "violence cannot
obstruct our determination to pursue democracy."
</P>
<P>
A day after surviving the assassination attempt, Chen and Lu of
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are battling for re-election
against their sole challengers -- the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James
Soong.
</P>
<P>
Lien, accompanied by his wife, two sons and daughter, went to the
polling station near his home in Taipei's bustling Chunghsiao East
Road shopping district at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Lien said he had come early to vote in the presidential poll with
a view to encouraging his supporters not to be swayed by Friday's
shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
"We should not let a simple violent event change our minds and
change our destiny, " Lien told reporters after casting his ballot.
His remarks were seen by many as an attempt to dampen the possible
"sympathy vote" effect for the Chen-Lu ticket caused by the
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Lien and his family members didn't pick up referendum ballots as
the "pan-blue alliance" has held the position that the President
Chen-initiated referendum on missile defense and relations with
mainland China is "illegal and unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
Lien's running mate, James Soong, also cast his ballot in the
presidential poll at a polling station in Taipei County's Linko
township early in the morning. He was accompanied by his wife and
their daughter. They also didn't vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Former President Lee Teng-hui cast his ballots in both the
presidential election and the referendum. Lee, who had campaigned for
President Chen's re-election bid, said he felt regret over Friday's
shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has come a long way in its pursuit of freedom and
democracy. There shouldn't be any more violence or tragedies, " he
urged.
</P>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun returned to Taipei after casting his ballots
in his hometown in the northeastern county of Ilan. Yu said he has
directed the national defense, foreign affairs, interior, and justice
ministers as well as other relevant department heads to stay in their
offices after casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
"All relevant government agencies should work out response
measures to cope with any possible disputes or conflicts in the wake
of Friday's incident and in the voting and vote-counting process," Yu
said.

Referring to Friday's shooting of her and President Chen on the
campaign trail in the southern city of Tainan, Lu said the incident
was a "battle between bullets and ballots." Lu sustained minor
injuries to her right knee in the shooting while Chen was grazed in
his abdomen. Lien claimed that the shooting of the president and vice
president on the eve of the presidential poll was suspicious and that
its influence on the vote should be investigated.
</P>
<P>
Lu said Lien's allegations were unfounded. "Since the incident is
still being investigated, we should refrain from speculation, " Lu
said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has come a long way in its pursuit of freedom
and democracy, Lu said all local people should respect Taiwan's
hard-won democratic system.
</P>
<P>
After winning a second four-year term, Lu said she will work with
President Chen and other DPP members in promoting social, economic,
judicial and political reforms as well as pursuing international
justice.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who holds a master's degree in law from the University of
Illinois, was a women's rights campaigner before joining mainstream
party politics. She received a 12-year prison term in 1980 for
helping organize Taiwan's first unauthorized mass demonstration by
the opposition in the previous year. When she was released in 1985,
she continued to campaign for better human rights and democracy under
Kuomintang rule.
</P>
<P>
In 1986 she joined other leading opposition members in forming the then
illegal Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), now the ruling party. She was also
behind the drive in 1993 pushing for Taiwan's re-entry to the United Nations,
which was dropped in favor of mainland China in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Lu was a member of parliament in 1993-96 and was serving as the highest
elected official for Taoyuan county when the DPP's Chen Shui-bian asked her to
be his running mate for the 2000 presidential race. The DPP's
surprise victory made her the highest-ranking woman in the
government.

<P>
Business leaders called on the public
Sunday to accept the March 20 presidential election results
rationally.
</P>
<P>
After a group of supporters of opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan and his running mate, People First Party Chairman James
Soong -- who formed the "pan-blue alliance" ticket in the just
concluded election -- staged a protest in front of the Presidential
Office against what they claim is an "unfair" election, Huang
Mao-hsiung, president of the Taiwan Federation of Industry
Association, said that the contestants should respect election
results in a democratic society, regardless of how slim the margin
between winner and loser.
</P>
<P>
Any disputes over the election should be settled by judicial
means and the public should return to normal life immediately after
the election, he said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election results show that a majority of Taiwan's
people are willing to give President Chen Shui-bian four more years
to carry out his policies and that they wish to enjoy stability.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy has been recovering since the second half
of last year, Huang noted, adding that this fact shows that the
policies of Chen's administration have borne fruit.
</P>
<P>
Huang called on the public to appreciate the hard-earned economic
recovery, which he said can only be maintained with social stability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gary Wang, president of the General Chamber of
Commerce of the Republic of China, said the public should wait for a
judicial ruling with regard to Lien's appeal for an annulment of the
election in a cool and rational manner.
</P>
<P>
The business sector wishes for a stable environment, Wang went
on, adding that Taiwan's economic foundation cannot afford to be
shaken if the country wants to continue to advance.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of angry supporters of the Lien-Soong ticket have
staged a protest at their campaign headquarters and in front of the
Presidential Office since Chen won Saturday's election by a narrow
margin. They are demanding that the election be annulled.
</P>
<P>
Protests also erupted in other major cities around Taiwan after
Chen's victory by less than 30,000 votes.

Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu
said Sunday that the government's present industrial development
policy will continue to be carried out during President Chen
Shui-bian's second term in office.
</P>
<P>
Chen won re-election by a razor-thin margin in Saturday's hotly

an appeal for a vote recount.
</P>

Until the controversy over the election results is cleared up,
Lin said, the government will continue to implement the industrial
policy that has proved effective and successful.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the present industrial policy emphasizes
technological innovation, efficiency and reform, Lin said the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will continue to help local
enterprises expand globally while keeping their business roots in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lin went on, the government will continue with
financial reforms and offer easier terms for local companies needing

GUNSHOT TREATMENT PHOTOS OF PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT RELEASED

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office released Sunday
eight photos documenting the medical treatment given to President
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu after they were both
shot in a gun attack Friday, in a bid to dissipate opposition doubts
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
Six photos of Chen and two of Lu were released during a press
conference. Also present were two medical officials -- Hsiao Tzu-yu
and Chien Hsiung-fei -- as well as photography official Liu
Hsiu-ming, who accompanied the Chen-Lu ticket during their campaign
in southern Taiwan, where the shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the news conference, Huang Chih-fang, director of the
Public Affairs Department under the Presidential Office, said that he
and the three officials all witnessed the attack, which took place in
the southern city of Tainan ahead of Saturday's presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that after the shooting, both Chen and Lu were rushed
to Chi Mei Medical Center for emergency treatment and that Liu took
photos of the process of the medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
As the opposition camp has cast doubt on the veracity of the
attack, the Presidential Office decided to release the photos in an
attempt to dissipate the doubts, even though the president's medical
treatment data is supposed to be confidential, Huang told local
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Huang voiced the hope that the publication of the photos will
help put an end to disputes concerning the incident. The judicial
authorities are investigating the attack and Chen will respect
investigation results, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a legal consultant of the Chi Mei Medical Center said
that the center has offered six items of evidence concerning the
medical treatment to the Tainan District Court to facilitate the
investigation.

Independent legislator and TV personality
Sisy Chen left Taipei for Seoul Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Chen, a former spokesman for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party who turned out to be one of the scathing critics of President
Chen Shui-bian, bought a full-priced air ticket to Seoul at the China
Airline counter at CKS International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Her departure on the heels of the re-election of President Chen
by a slim margin of less than 30,000 votes against his sole
challenger, Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
Though not a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , the
sharp-tongue and quick-witted Sisy Chen has actually been a great
boost to the KMT's camp by constantly claiming that President
Chen's administration is incompetent.
</P>
<P>
Sisy Chen raised many questions about the situation surrounding
the shooting of President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu when
they were canvassing in Tainan, southern Taiwan Friday afternoon.
Chen urged voters not to be influenced by the incident, which is
believed to have played a certain role in President Chen's
re-election in the hotly contested election.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Lu both sustained injuries during the attack and checked
out of the hospital in the evening. They later appeared in a taped
video to assure the public of their wellbeing. The last-night
campaign rallies scheduled prior to the election of the two rival
teams were canceled due to the first major violence during a
presidential election in Taiwan's history.

BEIJING SHOULD ACCEPT INCREASING TAIWAN CONSCIOUSNESS: DPP LAWMAKER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  21 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing should face and accept the
increasing Taiwan-centric consciousness in Taiwan society, a lawmaker
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum hosted by CNA on Taiwan's democratization and
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Kuo Jeng-liang said that the
development of Taiwan-centric consciousness has three stages, with
its core concept moving from political power, sovereignty and
national identity.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the development has prompted a reshuffle of domestic
political forces, Kuo said that Beijing should face in a positive
manner Taiwan's changing internal situation and accept that the
nature of its politics has changed.
</P>
<P>
For President Chen Shui-bian, who won re-election a day earlier
for another four-year term, Kuo said that dealing with the so-called
three direct cross-strait links -- trade, transportation and postal
services -- will be the most imminent problem for his administration.
</P>
<P>
Chao Chien-min, a professor with the Sun Yat-sen Graduate
Institute of Social Science and Humanities of National Chengchi
University, shared Kuo's view, saying that Taiwan-centric
consciousness has reached an unprecedented height.
</P>
<P>
However, Chao noted, Taiwan-centric consciousness is not
tantamount to Taiwan independence, but instead gives priority to
Taiwan's insterests. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait will spend
more time on crisis management rather than creating a sound framework
for cross-strait interaction, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The three direct links, writing a new constitution by 2006 and
regaining the trust of the United States will also be major
challenges for Chen's administration, Chao went on.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shei-saint, a legislator of the opposition Kuomintang, said
that a middle-way force for dealing with cross-strait issues is
emerging in Taiwan in light of the fact that both the ruling and
opposition camps has been moving toward the center in handling
cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
Following President Chen's re-election, Beijing should set aside
the prerequisite of its "one China" principle if it wishes to
increase cross-strait exchanges, he suggested.

Lien, who narrowly lost the election to the incumbent President
Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progress Party, made the appeal in a

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian has instructed
the administration to handle the opposition's protests over
Saturday's presidential election results in an open and transparent
manner, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yu quoted Chen as saying that the dissatisfaction of the
opponents' supporters over his victory by a slim margin Saturday is
fully understandable.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Vice President Annette Lu won their re-election bid by
garnering 6,471,970 votes, beating the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate, People
First Party Chairman James Soong, by a razor-thin margin of 0.228
percent.
</P>
<P>
Chen was also quoted by Yu as instructing that the Executive Yuan
should deal with all ensuing controversies speedily and that the
government should fully trust any decisions that the courts make
concerning a vote recount and other electoral affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yu issued directives to the National Police
Administration and other law enforcement agencies islandwide to take a
"soft" approach to handling protests.
</P>
<P>
Yu stressed that the government respects the opposition's
decision to seek the election's annulment via legal process, but
considers that illegal gatherings of protesters should not continue
uncontrolled.
</P>
<P>
Yu said he is fully aware that it had been a long night after
Saturday's presidential election, with sporadic strife staged by
angry voters islandwide, including a man who rammed his car into the
District Prosecutors' Office in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to accept the election results, Lien declared Saturday
night that he would file a lawsuit to seek the election's annulment
and demanded that all ballots now held by polling authorities in 25
cities and counties nationwide be recounted.
</P>
<P>
"Pan-blue alliance" supporters continued a sit-in in front of the
Presidential Office that began Saturday night.

ELECTION  DISPUTE SHOULD BE RESOLVED THROUGH JUSTICE: PREMIER

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun called Sunday for the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" leaders and their supporters to trust
and respect the decision of the justices in dealing with their
dispute over the presidential election results.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the appeal while responding to a demand
by pan-blue supporters at a press conference that the Executive Yuan
should give them "an answer" with regard to the election results.
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate, People FIrst
Party Chairman James Soong immediately filed a lawsuit with the
Taiwan High Court to demand an annulment of the election results and
a recount of the ballots after they lost by a razor-thin margin to
the incumbent President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
of the Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
They also led their supporters in a protest over what they
consider an "unfair election" in front of the Presidential Office
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the pan-blue supporters "are aiming at a wrong
target and use the wrong method" in seeking a resolution of the
dispute, Yu said that the issue has been passed on to the judicial
institutions and that the pan-blue supporters must trust their
decision.
</P>
<P>
The government respects the right of the pan-blue alliance to
resolve the election dispute through the established legal mechanism,
the premier said, adding however that the alliance should not
continue its "illegal gathering" in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the High Court has already decided to seize all
the ballot boxes, the premier said that the alliance's supporters
should stop worrying.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the question of an increasing number of spoiled
ballots in the election, the premier explained that activists had
appealed to the voters during the campaign to spoil their ballots,
while the passage of a law last year to strictly define vote validity
could also be a reason for the spoiled ballots.
</P>
<P>
Yu said the pan blue disappointment should be balanced by their
perception of democracy and added that it is pointless to tarnish
Taiwan's international image because of an election.
</P>
<P>
The premier also said that he respects Lien and expressed hope
that he will lead his supporters in the right direction.

Chen's re-election represents the fact that the awareness of

MND TO SUIT ARMS PROCUREMENT PROJECTS TO NATIONAL DEMAND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
will come up with arms procurement projects best suited to the
nation's defense needs, Vice Defense Minister Lin Chong-pin said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Defense Committee, where he was asked whether the ministry's arms
procurement plans will be affected by Saturday's referendum results.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's first nationwide referendum failed to reach the
threshold to be considered valid. A total of 45.17 percent of
eligible voters cast their ballots in the first question in the
referendum -- whether the country should strengthen its anti-missile
defense capability -- and 45.12 percent voted on the second question
-- whether the country should negotiate a peace framework with
mainland China. Both failed to reach the required threshold of 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Lin said the results will not have any impact on the MND's arms
procurement plans. Prior to the referendum, President Chen Shui-bian
had said that Taiwan will act on the referendum questions in a
positive way regardless of the outcome of the referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, the MND will seek the legislature's approval of
a special budget plan for the procurement of three badly needed
weaponry systems -- Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries, P3C Orion
anti-submarine aircraft and conventional submarines.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Lin said the MND will arrange budget plans for
other weaponry systems and military equipment according to combat
requirements.
</P>
<P>
"Arms procurement plans will be timed to coincide with progress
in troop reductions, weaponry renovation and combat capability
upgrading," Lin explained.

KINMEN OFFICIAL RULES OUT BALLOT RIGGING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The large number of invalid ballots cast
in the just-concluded presidential election could be attributed to
the stringent regulations governing the way invalid ballots are
identified, a Kinmen election official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's presidential poll, 337,297 ballots, or 2.5 percent
of the total ballots cast, were counted as invalid. The unprecedented
large number of invalid ballots has become one of the "suspicions"
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" has raised in its moves to have
the election annulled.
</P>
<P>
Among the country's 25 cities and counties, the frontline island
of Kinmen registered the second-highest ratio of invalid ballots in
the election, with 3.66 percent, or 1,069, invalid ballots. The
highest ratio was recorded in Yunlin County, with 3.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
Lee Tseng-tsai, secretary-general of the Kinmen County Election
Commission, said he believes that the high ratio mainly resulted from
a revision to the President and Vice President Election and Recall
Law that was passed by the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
last October.
</P>
<P>
According to the new provision, a vote is valid if the stamp is
made in a box above the photo of the candidate. In the past, a ballot
was valid if the stamp was made over the candidate's name or his or
her ballot number.
</P>
<P>
Before the March 20 presidential poll, Lee said, the election
commission clearly briefed all election staff on the new regulation
regarding the identification of invalid ballots.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the larger number of invalid ballots was related
to this more stringent standard for valid ballots, " Lee said, adding
that he did not think any election worker would deliberately count a
properly stamped valid ballot as invalid.
</P>
<P>
The unusually high number of invalid votes has formed the basis
of "pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate Lien Chan's claim that
the election might have been rigged. Lien has demanded a recount of
all ballots cast in Saturday's election in which he lost to incumbent
President Chen Shui-bian by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 ballots.
</P>
<P>
Lien and his running mate -- People First Party Chairman James
Soong -- have mobilized their supporters to stage a sit-in at the
Presidential Office square since they lost Saturday's presidential
poll by a razor-thin margin. The marathon protest has continued
into Monday night.
</P>
<P>
At Lien's request, the Taiwan High Court ordered all ballot boxes
sealed Sunday. Lien has demanded an across-the-board vote recount,
arguing that incumbent President Chen Shui-bian unfairly received
sympathy votes because of a mysterious election-eve shooting and that
the number of invalid ballots was, in his opinion, "unusually high."
</P>
<P>
Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were both shot and slightly
wounded while riding in an open Jeep Friday in the southern city of
Tainan. Chen won Saturday's election with just 50.1 percent of the
vote, compared to 49.9 percent for Lien -- a margin of just 29,518
ballots.
</P>
<P>
In addition to demanding a recount, Lien has also demanded
that the government form a special task force of medical and
criminal experts to investigate the attack on Chen and its influence
on the election.

FEBRUARY UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RISES SLIGHTLY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The unemployment rate rose slightly by
0.08 percentage points to 4.61 percent in February, according to
statistics compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobless increased by 8,000 from the previous
month's level to 468,000, DGBAS officials said, attributing the
increase to a seasonal expiration of contracts in the wake of the
Chinese New Year holiday, which fell in late January this year.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, the rate is 0.56 percentage points less than
the previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
Given that President Chen Shui-bian has won re-election, they
noted, the government is expected to extend its job-creation program
that will expire at the end of June. The program has created more
than 102,000 jobs since its implementation last year.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is expected to remain below the 5 percent
mark this year as a result of the government's efforts, they added.

DEFENSE MINISTER RETAINED BY PREMIER AFTER OFFERING TO RESIGN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Minister of
National Defense Tang Yiau-min has agreed, on the urging of the
premier, to stay in the Cabinet Monday after offering to resign.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a spokesman for the Ministry of National
Defense said that Tang presented his resignation letter to Premier Yu
Shyi-kun for health reasons on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng, said Tang has eye
disease which combined his advanced age have made the minister feel
that he probably won't be able to live up to his job as head of the
country's national defense.
</P>
<P>
Huang said Tang verbally reported his intention to quit to
President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Yu Shyi-kun the day before the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Tang was admitted to Tri Service General Hospital Sunday after
feeling acute pain in his left eye and a decrease in sight.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Chang Cheng-chung, a chief ophthalmologist at the hospital
said Tang was found suffering from a ulcer of the cornea and needs
active treatment.
</P>
<P>
The ophthalmologist said Tang has been troubled by eye disease
for six or five years and has sought treatment at the Tri Service
General Hospital at least 20 times.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the recurrence of Tang's eye disease this time was
caused by overwork and lack of rest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tang's failure to give a briefing about a military
arms procurement program after the presidential election to the
National Defense Committee at the Legislative Yuan Monday morning
raised the ire of the committee's chairwoman, Chin Hui-chu, and other
members.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Tang has attended the meetings of the Legislative
Yuan only twice during the last legislative session and only once
this session, they blamed the minister for giving them too few
briefings and said the minister was trying to excused himself from
Monday's briefing under the pretext of eye disease.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he suffers from eye disease, Tang asked Vice Defense
Minister Lin Chong-pin to be his substitute at the briefing.

ACTIVATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY MECHANISM DID NOT AFFECT VOTE: MND
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice Minister of National Defense Lin
Chong-pin stressed Monday that the activation of the mechanism to
ensure national security following the attack on President Chen
Shui-bian Friday had not affected the voting rights of military
personnel the following day.
</P>
<P>
Lin made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee
when he was reporting on the cross-strait military situation and arms
purchase programs after the presidential election and referendum
vote.
</P>
<P>
But opposition legislators focused their attention on whether the
activation of the national security mechanism had affected the voting
rights of military personnel. President Chen won re-election Saturday
by a slim margin of less than 30,000 votes against his rival,
Chairman Lien Chan of the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
The special framework to ensure national security was activated
following the attack on President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu after they were shot and injured while canvassing in
Tainan, the ruling party's stronghold in southern Taiwan, Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang Legislator Chiang Chi-wen, People First Party
legislators Ku Chung-lien, Lin Yu-fang, Chin Huei-chu and others said
that since the injuries to the president and vice president were not
serious and that the presidential election went ahead as scheduled,
"there was no need to activate the national security mechanism."
</P>
<P>
They also alleged that the Ministry of National Defense (MND) had
revised regulations last August so that after the national security
mechanism had been activated, military personnel could not leave
their posts to vote in rotation, which had been the case previously.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Wu Cheng-tien wondered why Minister of National
Defense Tang Yiau-min visited the outlying island of Kinmen on
election day, resulting in 3,000 military personnel on leave who were
not allowed to vote, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Lin stressed that Minister Tang was unlikely to prohibit those
who were on leave from voting.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the activation of the national security
mechanism had not affected the voting rights of those military
personnel on leave, and only affected the more than 13,000 who were
on combat alert against possible moves by mainland China during the
presidential election.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OFFERS HELP TO TAIPEI CITY TO CALM PROTESTERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The central government will help Taipei
City to calm protesters and render whatever support the city needs to
defuse the opposition's ongoing rally in the wake of Saturday's
presidential election, Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lin said at a news conference that Premier Yu Shyi-kun fully
understands the awkward situation that Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou is
facing now being top administrative official in Taiwan's capital city
while being a campaign manager for the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
presidential ticket of Lien Chan and James Soong, who lost to
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu by a
razor-thin margin of 0.228 percent, or 6,442,452 votes to 6,471,970
votes.
</P>
<P>
Having refused to accept the election results, "pan-blue
alliance" supporters continued their sit-in Monday in front of the
Presidential Office that began Saturday night. They filed a lawsuit
with the Taiwan High Court to seek an annulment of the presidential
election and to have all presidential ballots nationwide recounted.
</P>
<P>
The protesters are demonstrating on the grounds that the
circumstances surrounding the unexplained assassination attempt
against Chen and Lu on the eve of the election have yet to be
understood clearly and that the number of ballots certified invalid
was unusually high.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the central government is in full support of the
Taipei City Government in solving problems related to the aftermath
of the election, particularly the disruption of social order around
the Presidential Office and the concerns of the average citizen as to
how far the protesters will go to take matters into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the protesters to go home so that the mayor
does not have to face such a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
Lin said while it is right to show magnanimity to one's opponent
and sympathy with the losing side, it is wrong to take an irrational
attitude and act on disputes, which, he said, should be solved
through legal processes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commenting on the continuing demonstration that the
"pan-blue alliance" supporters have staged in front of the
Presidential Office, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party said that the election is over and they should go
home and face the new reality.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislative party whip Tsai Huang-lang said that President
Chen's opponents, "pan-blue alliance" leaders Lien and Soong, should
face the results now that the election is over and demonstrate their
democratic magnanimity.
</P>
<P>
Lien and Soong should respect the law and follow judicial rules
to serve as an example of democratization for their supporters,
instead of manipulating pluralism and public opinion, Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and Taipei
Mayor Ma, both head officials of the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
campaign headquarters, should step forward to persuade alliance
supporters to go home and wait for judicial decisions on any
disputes.

links by the end of 2004.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the MOTC completed an overall assessment on
Taiwan's opening of direct transportation links based on the
"three-stage" timetable and submitted it to the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) for the council's reference last year. The MAC is the
top agency in charge of formulating Taiwan's mainland China policies.
</P>
<P>
Lin added that when policy makers give the green light, the MOTC
will have no problems in dealing with the technical matters
pertaining to direct cross-strait links.

distinguished man."

DPP CAUCUS PROPOSES AMENDMENT TO FACILITATE VOTE RECOUNT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) put forward a proposal at the
Legislative Yuan Tuesday aimed at legitimizing a recounting of the
votes in Saturday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The DPP legislative caucus proposed an amendment to the President
and Vice President Election and Recall Law to allow losers of an
election to request a vote recount if the margin of the loss is less
than 1 percent of the total ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket of
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James
Soong have continued their sit-in in front of the presidential palace
that began Saturday night, claiming the March 20 election was
"unfair" and demanding a recount.
</P>
<P>
The Lien-Soong ticket lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu by a razor-thin margin of just under
30,000 votes, or 0.228 percent of the total votes counted.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to clear up the opposition's doubts and seek an
early settlement to the election dispute, which has disrupted social
order and plunged the Taipei stock market, the DPP caucus has put
forward the proposal and has called for an extra voting session
Tuesday for speedy passage of the amendment, DPP legislative party
whip Tsai Huang-lang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the proposed amendment can go through the three
readings at the Legislative Yuan before nightfall Tuesday so that it
can be formally passed into law and implemented by Thursday, " Tsai
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition "pan-blue alliance" legislators voiced
doubts about the feasibility of the DPP's timetable, saying it is
impossible for the amendment to be passed into law within two days
given the existing legislative structure and voting process.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the demonstrators cannot wait any longer, Liao
Feng-teh, a Kuomintang legislative party whip, demanded that the
Central Election Commission (CEC) immediately convene a members
meeting to pass a motion, with the consent of at least half of the
CEC members, asking for an administrative recount of Saturday's votes
without delay.

TAIWAN AND G-10 GROUP MEMBERS TO HOLD TALKS WITH MAJOR WTO MEMBERS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan will join other members of the G-10
Group in holding a series of meetings beginning Tuesday with major
World Trade Organization (WTO) members and groups as the agricultural
talks of the Doha Round Trade talks resumed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The G-10 Group, made up of Taiwan, Bulgaria, Israel, Iceland,
Japan, Mauritius, Norway, Switzerland, South Korea and Liechtenstein,
is aimed at protecting and advancing the agricultural interests of
its members.
</P>
<P>
A well-placed source in Geneva revealed Monday that members of
the G-10 Group will hold various consultation meetings with the
United States, the European Union, the G-20 Group nations as well as
with other agricultural product exporting nations and the "Special
Products Union" to consolidate their common positions in the
agricultural negotiations of the Doha Round Trade talks.
</P>
<P>
The G-20 Group consists of 20 developed nations, while the
"Special Products Union" is an organization of 42 developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth WTO Ministerial Conference held in Caucun, Mexico
last September marked a setback mainly because of the differences
among WTO members over issues regarding agricultural talks.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Yen Ching-chang, permanent representative of
Taiwan's mission to the WTO, will head officials from the Council of
Agriculture and his mission to participate in the upcoming meetings.

PRESIDENT GETS CONGRATULATORY MESSAGES FROM ABROAD: MOFA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Tuesday it has received messages from many foreign governments
and prominent political figures congratulating President Chen
Shui-bian on his re-election Saturday, despite the controversy over
the election results and demonstrations by opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular news conference, MOFA spokesman Richard
Shih said that as of Monday evening, governments and individual
political figures from 22 countries had sent congratulatory messages.
</P>
<P>
Those countries included Panama, Paraguay, the Dominican
Republic, Grenada, Chad, Senegal, Swaziland, The Gambia, the Solomon
Islands, Palau, the Marshall Islands, Japan, South Korea, Bangladesh,
Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Kiribati and Commonwealth of Dominica.
</P>
<P>
Shih said more congratulatory messages are expected to arrive in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Shih said, Foreign Affairs Minister Eugene Chien
briefed foreign ambassadors and representatives stationed in Taipei
on the election results.
</P>
<P>
Chen won with just 50.1 percent of the vote, compared to 49.9
percent for his sole challenger, opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan -- a margin of just 29,518 ballots.
</P>
<P>
Lien and his running mate -- People First Party Chairman James
Soong -- immediately mobilized some of their supporters to stage a
sit-in in front of the Presidential Office to protest what they are
describing as an "unfair" election.
</P>
<P>
At Lien's request, the Taiwan High Court ordered all ballot boxes
sealed Sunday. Lien has demanded an immediate vote recount, claiming
that Chen "unfairly" received sympathy votes after being injured in a
mysterious election-eve shooting and that the number of invalid
ballots was, in his opinion, "unusually high."
</P>
<P>
After Monday's background briefing for foreign envoys, Chien
quoted Douglas Paal, director of the Taipei Office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , as having said that the United States is
adopting a hands-off attitude toward the dispute over the election
result.
</P>
<P>
According to an AIT press statement released later that day, Paal
told Chen during a meeting last Sunday that the U.S.
position over the election dispute is that it is strictly an internal
affair.

NATIONAL STABILIZATION FUND NOT USED TO SUPPORT STOCK MARKET

<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that the
National Stabilization Fund has not been used to maintain a stable
stock market in the wake of Saturday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Even though the Taiwan bourse closed low Tuesday, Yu said, it did
not lose significant ground, so it was not deemed necessary for the
government to step in with the National Stabilization Fund.
</P>
<P>
Board members of the National Stabilization Fund discussed the
timing of using the fund to prop up the stock market, which has taken
abattering in the two trading days since the election, but decided no
action was needed. However, Chen Shuh, vice minister of finance who
doubles as executive secretary of the fund, is authorized to use the
fund to boost the market if need be.
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended the day lower on the Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TAIEX) Tuesday, with the weighted index, the market's key barometer,
losing 187.03 points to close at 6,172.89 with a total of 10.15
billion shares changing hands on a market turnover of NT$249.14
billion (US$7.44 billion), a sharp increase from the previous trading
session, which saw 220 million stocks traded on a market turnover of
NT$47.03 billion (US$1.40 billion).
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors' selling, however, outnumbered buying in the
trading session by NT$19.46 billion (US$580 million) , the
third-highest single day selling on record. Because of the political
turmoil following the election and ensuing controversy, foreign
investors, joined by investment trust companies and securities
brokers, have tended to play the part of onlookers for the time
being.

AIT ANNOUNCES NEW APPOINTMENT SYSTEM FOR NON-IMMIGRANT VISAS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
announced Tuesday that a new appointment system for applicants for
non-immigrant visas to the United States will go into effect
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The AIT, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence
of formal diplomatic ties, said the new system will apply to tourist,
business and student visa applicants.
</P>
<P>
Keith Powell, an AIT section chief in charge of consular affairs,
told a news conference that the new system is already in use in most
large U.S. visa-issuing facilities throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The system will replace the AIT's existing caller-pay telephone
appointment system, Powell said, adding that the new system will
allow each applicant to set a specific time for a visa application
interview and will provide help to applicants in completing the
application forms.
</P>
<P>
From Wednesday, Powell said, all non-immigrant visa applicants
must go to the Atos Origin Application Processing Center (APC) -- the
AIT's new service provider -- to make an appointment for a visa
interview at AIT.
</P>
<P>
Powell said AIT will be able to handle more visa applicants more
quickly, thus reducing the waiting period for the interview and the
time needed to process a visa.
</P>
<P>
Both the visa application fee of NT$3,400, payable to Taiwan Post
Office account number 19189005, and the service charge of NT$240,
payable to Taiwan Post Office account number 19832104, must be paid
before submitting the visa application to the APC.
</P>
<P>
Applicants must bring a valid passport and receipts to the APC,
Powell said, adding that after accepting the application for
pre-processing, the APC will give each applicant a personal
identification number so that he or she can make an interview
appointment at AIT.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Powell said, the AIT is scheduled to start to collect
fingerprints and photos of visa applicants from Taiwan from September
in line with regulations unveiled by the U.S. Homeland Security
Department early this year. The AIT will not collect additional
charges for the fingerprints and photos, Powell said.

VALUE OF EXPORT ORDERS FOR FEBRUARY SETS 17-YEAR HIGH GROWTH RATE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The value of foreign orders placed with
Taiwan companies in February totaled US$15.04 billion, representing
an annual growth rate of 34.68 percent -- a record single-month high
in 17 years, a spokesman for the Statistics Department under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase rate -- worth about US$3.87 billion -- was a result
of rising prices for stable commodities such as steel and oil in the
international market and an improved economic situation in Asian and
European countries in contrast to the lower levels posted in February
last year, which was also the time of last year's Chinese new year
holiday period, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The value of the foreign orders received last month by Taiwan
semiconductor manufacturers rose by US$1.17 billion, an annual growth
rate of 56.36 percent, while orders for information technology and
telecommunications goods increased by US$430 million in value
year-on-year, representing an annual growth rate of 17.73 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign orders for locally manufactured metal and precision
machinery products rose by US$380 million in value each, reflecting
an increase rate of 35.06 percent and 118.24 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Hong Kong, Japan and countries in Europe were
the prime buyers for Taiwan-made products, with local electronics
products being the most popular item, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chang Yaw-tzong, director-general of the MOEA's
Statistics Department, said that short-term non-economic factors will
only have a minimal impact on the country's overall economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's export business will only be slightly affected as long
as political strife at home is settled quickly, Chang noted, adding
that the prospects for the domestic economy remain bright.
</P>
<P>
Chang was referring to the mass protest being held in Taipei over
the results of Saturday's presidential poll. Supporters of the
"pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate -- opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan -- lost the race by less than 30,000 votes to
President Chen Shui-bian, who won a second term in office.

PRESIDENT RESENTS VOTE-RIGGING CHARGES AGAINST HIM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
vote-rigging charges against him are a grave insult to his integrity.
</P>
<P>
"They called me a vote-rigging president. This is the biggest
humiliation to my character," Chen said in a raspier-than-usual voice
while meeting with the heads of the nation's five branches of
government at the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
In his first public appearance since claiming victory in the most
closely fought presidential election in Taiwan's history last
weekend, Chen said he favors a full recount of the ballots but that
the process must follow the principle of "rule of law."
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential ticket of
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James
Soong have alleged that Saturday's election was marred by
irregularities, but has so far presented little evidence to back
their claim.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he wants a quick recount to address all doubts. "I
won't object to a speedy, transparent and full-scale recount to help
us find the truth," Chen said, adding that he will accept the outcome
of the recount. "I'll accept it 100 percent, absolutely accept it, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lien's biggest complaint about the vote is that what he claims is
an "unusually high" number of ballots -- more than 330,000, or 10
times Chen's margin of victory -- were ruled invalid.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the high number might have been due to stricter
regulations that were used for the first time in accordance with a
revision to the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law
passed last October.
</P>
<P>
The rules required voters to register their candidate preferences
by putting a chop mark squarely inside a box above the candidate's
photo on the ballot. Ballots with stamps that crossed the boundary
lines were deemed invalid.
</P>
<P>
At Lien's demand, the Taiwan High Court seized and sealed all
ballot boxes Sunday and appointed three judges to study the case.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, only prosecutors and judges are eligible to
examine the ballots, a legal procedure that could take six months to
complete.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen said he does not oppose resolving the case through
political means. He suggested that the ruling and opposition parties
negotiate mutually acceptable terms and appoint credible judges to
recount the ballots. Another option would be to revise the law to
allow for people other than judges and prosecutors to examine the
ballots, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In any event, the government will resolve the dispute in line
with the principles of listening to the opposition camp's opinions,
understanding the feelings of the defeated contender and his
supporters, following the guidelines of rule of law and promoting
domestic unity and harmony," Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
The officials present at Tuesday's meeting included Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng, Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng, Control Yuan
President Fredrick Chien and Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen.
</P>
<P>
Looking a little under the weather, Chen further said it is
regrettable that some people have accused him of faking the
election-eve assassination attempt against him to win sympathy votes.
</P>
<P>
"Some people have asked if the shooting was real or faked. I
could understand such doubts because the campaign was so heated, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office has released photos of the wound and of
his physicians treating the injury. Lien has demanded that an
independent task force made up of both foreign and local experts be
set up to investigate the shooting. Police have yet to identify
suspects or other important leads.
</P>
<P>
Chen was lightly wounded when an unidentified assailant fired at
least two shots at himself and Vice President Annette Lu while they
were driving past large crowds of supporters in an open-top jeep in
the southern city of Tainan last Friday. The shooting grazed Chen's
abdomen and hit Lu's right knee.
</P>
<P>
Noting that he and Lu were more eager than anyone else to get to
the bottom of the incident, Chen said he would welcome independent
third-party participation in an inquiry into the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
"We are the ones who were shot. We are more eager than anyone
else to find out the truth," Chen added.

EXECUTIVE YUAN HOPES TO RECOUNT BALLOTS WEEKEND AFTER NEXT

Taipei, March 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Executive Yuan hopes that a recount of
the ballots from Saturday's presidential election will be conducted
the weekend after next, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan Secretary-General Liu Shih-fang said that the
Executive Yuan has invited the Ministry of the Interior and the
Central Election Commission (CEC) to discuss the recounting
procedure.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Executive Yuan hopes that the Legislative Yuan
passes the third reading of a draft revising the President and Vice
President Election and Recall Law Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and People First Party must retract the lawsuit they filed
after Saturday's presidential election to nullify the election and
its outcome to begin the recounting process, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
On the timing of the recount, Liu said that this would be up to
the Central Election Commission to decide, although the Executive
Yuan hopes to complete it the weekend after next. Presidential
candidates or their designated representatives and prosecutors will
be invited to witness the recounting process, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that it should be possible to complete the recounting in
one day at a cost of about NT$300 million to NT$500 million
(US$9.09 million to US$15.15 million).
</P>
<P>
Recounting the votes by this weekend would be rushing things, she
said, adding that the weekend after next might be an ideal time,
although the decision remains with the CEC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said that the application to recount the ballots
will not affect the scheduled publication by the CEC of the results
of the election on March 26.
</P>
<P>
"If the recount proves that Lien won, then the CEC will still be
able to retract its earlier publication," she said.
</P>
<P>
The CEC is scheduled to convene a meeting March 26 during which
its members will review the presidential election outcome and publish
the names of those elected.

TSU LAWMAKERS ACCUSE TAIPEI MAYOR OF FAILING TO DEAL WITH SIT-IN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five legislators of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) lodged a complaint Tuesday with the Control
Yuan against Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou for failing to deal with a
sit-in staged by supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" in
front of the Presidential Office following the March 20 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
After accepting the complaint jointly filed by Chen Chien-ming,
Chien Lin Whei-jun, Ho Min-hao, Lo Chih-ming and Huang Tsung-yuan,
the Control Yuan member on duty that day said the watchdog agency
will form a task force to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
The five TSU lawmakers said that after refusing to accept the
election results, the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong
mobilized supporters to stage a sit-in in front of the Presidential
Office to protest against what they describe as an "unfair" election.
</P>
<P>
As the "pan-blue alliance" supporters have continued their sit-in
since Saturday's poll, the TSU legislators said that the
demonstration has infringed upon the Assembly Law and added that the
protesters' occupation of nearby roads and their noise-making are
jeopardizing social order.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that according to the Assembly Law, the organizers
of any assembly must lodge an application with local police
authorities six days prior to the planned activity, they questioned
why the Taipei city government accepted an application submitted by
the "pan-blue alliance" after it launched the protest and why it
failed to crack down on the protesters in accordance with the
Assembly Law.
</P>
<P>
The Lien-Soong ticket lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu by a razor-thin margin of just under
30,000 votes, or 0.228 percent of the total votes counted in the
March 20 presidential election.

LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER WILL MEDIATE TALKS ON REVISING ELECTION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Tuesday he will mediate negotiations the same evening between
lawmakers of various political factions to explore the possibility of
revising the law to recount of votes in the controversial
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Although it would be quicker for the Central Election Committee
(CEC) to order a recount of the votes in the just-concluded
presidential election, the legal framework for such an order is weak,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Revising the current law might be somewhat time consuming but in
the end would be more practical. The aim is to revise the law to call
for recounts in cases where the difference between votes for the
winner and runner-up in the presidential election is very small.
</P>
<P>
In Wang's view, if different parties agree to revise the law in
the negotiations Tuesday evening, the Legislative Yuan may enact it
in a legislative session on Thursday, which will open the door for a
recount of the votes.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a skirmish between lawmakers of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) earlier in the day over whether the ongoing dispute
between the DPP and the alliance of the KMT and the People First
Party (PFP) should be settled through revising the President and Vice
President Election and Recall Law.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Liao Feng-teh, who is the chairman of the Rules
Committee of the Legislative Yuan, turned down the request of a group
of DPP lawmakers on the committee to put onto the agenda a proposal
to revise the law to provide for a recount of votes when the
difference between the winner and the loser in the presidential
election is less than 1 percent of the total votes.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that it was the CEC that should order a recount, Liao
refused to discuss the DPP lawmakers' idea and ordered a recess of
the meeting, which irritated the DPP lawmakers. One of them chased
after him and stopped him from leaving the meeting room and a
skirmish ensued.
</P>
<P>
The dispute arises from the March 20 presidential election in
which the KMT's candidate, Lien Chan, and his running make, PFP
Chairman James Soong, lost by 0.228 percent.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the election was unfair, the two have led their
supporters to protest in front of the Presidential Office where they
have been since Sunday morning, asking for a recount of the votes.

TAIWAN HOPES TO LURE FOREIGN TOURISTS FOLLOWING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications has asked its overseas stations to
try to attract foreign visitors to Taiwan now that the emotional
presidential election has ended, a spokesman for the bureau said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after being notified by its
missions stationed in Japan that many Japanese tourists have put off
their travel plans to Taiwan in view of the present situation in
Taiwan -- mainly the mass protest being held in Taipei over the
results of Saturday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Japan has long been Taiwan's No. 1 source of foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the bureau has demanded its overseas outposts
to clarify and give an explanation of the current situation in Taiwan
to local travel agencies in their host countries, especially those in
Japan, the spokesman said that the bureau's outposts abroad have made
it clear that foreign travelers should visit Taiwan without fear,
because Taiwan is a country ruled by law and order.
</P>
<P>
The outbreaks of the potentially deadly severe acute respiratory
syndrome in the first half of last year in Taiwan and a spread of an
avian flu in Japan and other Asian nations have largely affected the
travel willingness of Japanese people, the spokesman said, noting
that the number of Japanese tourists to Taiwan has dropped by over 30
percent since the beginning of this year until now as compared to the
previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of people from Hong Kong and Macau
visiting Taiwan rose by 3 percent in January over the year-earlier
level, but the February number plunged by 34 percent year-on-year.
Hong Kong and Macau generate the second-largest number of tourists
for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian won his re-election by a very slim
margin of less than 30,000 votes over his challenger -- major
opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, prompting the latter to
question the fairness of the election. A group of Lien's supporters
have gathered in the square in front of the Presidential Office since
late Saturday to demand a recount.

NEUTRALITY FIRST IN INVESTIGATING SHOOTING OF PRESIDENT: PROSECUTOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prosecutor general in Tainan, southern
Taiwan, stressed Tuesday that judicial neutrality will take
precedence over political party affiliation in investigating the
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wei-chung said that there are four prosecutors investigating
the shooting, and he has no need to expand the task force.
</P>
<P>
Liu was responding to reports that the task force is excluding
other prosecutors from taking part in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Both the president and the vice president were injured in the
attack when they were canvassing in Tainan Friday afternoon, the
shooting might have played a role in the bitterly contested
presidential election, in which Chen won by a razor-thin margin
against his challenger, Chairman Lien Chan of the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Lien has raised questions about the shooting, demanding that an
independent task force be formed by local and foreign experts to
investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that he would like to see other district prosecutors
providing information and other creative ideas to track down the
possible shooter or shooters, but that they would not be directly
involved with the hands-on, day-to-day work of the four
investigators.
</P>
<P>
Police have so far made no arrests and have not announced any
suspects or leads. They did find two bullets, and have said that
possible suspects include gamblers who illegally wagered a lot of
money on the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
"Four prosecutors are enough, " Liu said, adding that the role of
the prosecutors is to command police forces in their investigations
and more prosecutors would not be helpful.
</P>
<P>
On questions about the party affiliations of the prosecutors and
whether a balanced proportion between the two rival camps should be
maintained, Liu pointed to the judicial neutrality of the
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
He said that "judicial neutrality will supersede that of party
affiliation, " and that "it is not necessary to add more prosecutors
to the case and I will not do so."

TAIPEI MAYOR MA YING-JEOU WELCOMES AMENDMENT TO FACILITATE RECOUNT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou welcomed the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) move Tuesday to push for
an amendment to the President and Vice President Election and Recall
Law aimed at legalizing a recounting of the votes in Saturday's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ma said an early passage of the amendment -- put forward by the
DPP legislative caucus Tuesday at the Legislative Yuan -- will be
conducive to a quick and rational end to the demonstration which has
been going on in front of the Presidential Office by supporters of
the "pan-blue alliance" presidential ticket of Lien Chan and James
Soong since the evening of the election on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The Lien-Soong ticket lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu by a razor-thin margin of just under
30,000 votes, or 0.228 percent of the total votes counted. Some
"pan-blue alliance" supporters are protesting the March 20 election
as being "unfair" and are demanding a recount.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to remove any doubts by the opposition and to seek
an early settlement to the election dispute, which has disrupted
social order and caused a nosedive in the Taipei stock market, the
DPP caucus put forward the proposal and has called for an extra
voting session Tuesday for a speedy passage of the amendment, DPP
legislative party whip Tsai Huang-lang said.
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that the proposed amendment can go through the three
readings at the Legislative Yuan before nightfall Tuesday so that it
can be formally passed into law and implemented by Thursday, " Tsai
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition "pan-blue alliance" legislators voiced
doubts about the feasibility of the DPP's timetable, saying it is
impossible for the amendment to be passed into law within two days
given the existing legislative structure and voting process.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the demonstrators cannot wait any longer, Liao
Feng-teh, a Kuomintang legislative party whip, demanded that the
Central Election Commission (CEC) immediately convene a meeting to
pass a motion, with the consent of at least half of the CEC members,
asking for an administrative recount of Saturday's votes without
delay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mayor Ma called for the central government to take
charge of efforts to deal with the demonstration rally in front of
the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the demonstration is an issue of high political
sensitivity and is taking place in an area near the Presidential
Office. The Taipei City Government is unable to meet the protesters'
demands, he added.
</P>
<P>
Simply by asking the demonstrators to disperse and stop
disrupting the nearby hospital and schools has not had any effect, Ma
said, adding that it would be better if the central government took
over the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Taipei City Government will continue maintaining traffic
control and keeping the environment clean in the area surrounding the
Presidential Office once the central government takes over efforts to
appease the protesters, Ma added.

The Straits Times: Barisan Nasional
captures 90% of seats.

A day after his stunning landslide polls victory, Datuk Seri
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was sworn in as Malaysia's Prime Minister
yesterday, with the final election tally showing that his Barisan
Nasional (BN) had swept 198 of the 219 seats in Parliament.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Posted: Lien Chan rebuke Chen Shui-bian for
"stealing Taiwan" and wants recount votes and international probe of
assassination bid.

Taiwan's opposition has called for recounting presidential
election votes and international experts to probe the assassination
attempt of President Chen Shui-bian after police admitted they
had no suspect, key witnesses or clear motive.

The Kuomintang (KMT) believes Friday's shooting may have been
orchestrated to help Chen win a second term.

PRESIDENT SAYS VOTE-RIGGING CHARGE AN INSULT, FAVORS FULL RECOUNT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
vote-rigging charges against him were a grave insult to his
integrity.
</P>
<P>
"They called A-bian a vote-rigging president. This is the biggest
insult to my integrity, " Chen said while meeting with the heads of
the nation's five branches of government at the Presidential Office.
A-bian is Chen's nickname.
</P>
<P>
In his first public appearance since claiming victory in the most
closely fought presidential election in Taiwan's history last
weekend, Chen also said he favors a full recount of the ballots but
that the process must follow the law.
</P>
<P>
"I won't object to a full-scale recount to help us find the
truth," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential ticket of
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James
Soong alleged that Saturday's election was marred by irregularities,
but the alliance has so far presented little evidence.
</P>
<P>
President Chen also expressed his deep regret over allegations
that he faked an election-eve assassination attempt to win sympathy
votes.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely regrettable that some people claim that I had
faked the shooting incident on the final day of the campaign to boost
my re-election bid," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He was lightly wounded when an unidentified assailant fired at
least two shots at the president and Vice President Annette Lu while
they were driving past large crowds of supporters in an open-top jeep
in the southern city of Tainan last Friday. The shooting grazed
Chen's abdomen and hit Lu's right knee.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he would welcome independent third-party participation
in an investigation into the shooting incident after the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" demanded an external inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he and Vice President Lu were more eager than anyone to
get to the bottom of the incident. "We are the ones who were shot. We
are more eager than anyone else to find out the truth."

<P>
If the percentage of domestic workers laid
off or fired reaches a certain level, their employers will not be
allowed to apply to employ foreign laborers, the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To protect local workers, CLA officials said that they will
examine the employment records for the past two years of companies
seeking approval to hire foreign workers to see whether they have
exceeded the percentage limits.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that for employers of over 200 workers, if
they lay off or fire 16 percent of their workforce, they will be
prohibited from hiring foreign workers. For employers of between 20
and 199 workers, 37 percent is the cutoff. For those employing fewer
than 19 workers, the limit is 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the CLA's Employment and Vocational Training
Administration said that since the legal dismissal of domestic
workers is not directly related to the hiring of foreign workers,
they have formulated a more relaxed system.

LEGISLATIVE HEAD SUGGESTS PRESIDENT ISSUE DECREE FOR RECOUNT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
suggested Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian issue an emergency
decree to facilitate an immediate vote recount to clear up any doubts
surrounding Chen's victory in Saturday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested that President Chen issue the decree also to
facilitate the establishment of an ad hoc committee to conduct an
open and objective investigation into the unexplained assassination
attempt against Chen and Vice President Annette Lu on the eve of the
election. The sympathy generated by the incident is widely believed
to have given the Chen-Lu ticket a decisive boost in the election.
</P>
<P>
Wang said an emergency decree by the president is the best,
quickest and most efficient way of solving the election dispute,
which has disrupted social order and caused a nosedive in the Taipei
stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Yuan head made the suggestion during a meeting of
the presidents of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial, Examination
and Control Yuans called by President Chen. The meeting was the first
of its kind held in the wake of the election.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a campaign manager for the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
presidential ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party Chairman James Soong, said he made the suggestion to President
Chen in his capacity as the head of the Legislative Yuan -- a neutral
and independent position.
</P>
<P>
"Pan-blue alliance" supporters continued their sit-in in front of
the presidential palace that began Saturday night, claiming the March
20 election was "unfair" and demanding an open and immediate vote
recount.
</P>
<P>
The Lien-Soong ticket lost to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu by a razor-thin margin of just under
30,000 votes, or 0.228 percent of the total votes counted.

REFERENDUM ACT WILL BE REVISED: PREMIER

Taipei, March 21 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun directed the Ministry
of the Interior (MOI) Wednesday to bring forward a draft amendment to
the Referendum Act to the Executive Yuan for approval within a month.
</P>
<P>
Yu issued the directive during a weekly Cabinet meeting after
hearing a report on the March 20 presidential election and the first
nationwide referendum held in conjunction with the election.
</P>
<P>
In addition to electing a president and vice president, voters
also cast two additional ballots for the two referendum questions --
whether Taiwan should increase its anti-missile defenses if mainland
China refuses to remove the missiles it has aimed at Taiwan, and
whether the government should negotiate with Beijing for the
establishment of an interaction mechanism to promote peace across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
A total of 45.17 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots on
the first referendum question, while 45.12 percent voted on the
second question, thus failing to reach the required threshold of 50
percent. According to the Referendum Act, a referendum will be
considered valid only if more than half of the eligible voters take
part.
</P>
<P>
The holding of Taiwan's first referendum marked another step
forward on the government's efforts to deepen the nation's democracy,
even though the two referendum questions failed to pass the threshold
to be considered valid, Yu said, adding that he was happy to see more
than 7.4 million voters take part in the referendum to show the
Taiwan people's strong desire of pursuing peace across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
"Through the holding of the March 20 referendum, we have
discovered that there are still many inoperable provisions in the
existing Referendum Act which should be duly revised," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate smooth operations of future referendums, the
premier asked the MOI to submit a draft revision bill of the
Referendum Act within one month to the Executive Yuan for discussion.
The draft amendment will be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
approval within two months, he added.

<P>
"We hope our current trip can further help various European

WHO or to gain a seat in the WHA, " Lai said, adding that the
international community should not ignore the 23 million Taiwan
people's desire to have their voice heard in the WHO.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is scheduled to end their European visit April 2.
Meanwhile, Lai, a physician-turned-politician, will travel from Italy

NEARLY 64 PERCENT STILL CAUGHT UP IN ELECTION: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 64 percent of respondents to an
Internet poll said that they are still emotionally involved in the
aftermath of last Saturday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The online human resource company 1111.com.tw and Taiwan
Adventist Hospital jointly conducted the survey Tuesday, with over
2,000 effective questionnaires collected.
</P>
<P>
Wu Chun-ying, a spokesman of the online company, said that 53
percent of those responding to the Internet poll said they watched TV
all day Saturday, and nearly 30 percent said that they couldn't
accept the outcome of the election, which saw President Chen
Shui-bian win another four-year term by a slim margin of 0.228
percent, or fewer than 30,000 votes, against his challenger, Lien
Chan of the Kuomintang.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven percent also said that they couldn't sleep and were
anxious, showing signs of what has been termed "post-election
syndrome."
</P>
<P>
Lee Ming-ping, superintendent of the Taipei City Psychiatric
Center, said that there is no such disease as "post-election
syndrome, " in the medical sense; instead, it is viewed as something
that causes pressure, which could in turn exacerbate the conditions
of patients or trigger emotional disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 percent said that they continue to watch events unfold on
TV.
</P>
<P>
Lien filed a lawsuit right after the election to have it
nullified, claiming it was "unfair, " pointing particularly to the
shooting of President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu on the eve
of the vote, which the "pan-blue alliance" claims won enough sympathy
votes to hand the incumbent president victory. Supporters of the
"pan-blue alliance" continued their fourth day of protests in front
of the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that this shows that Taiwan voters are easily
affected by elections, and that this election has made a great impact
on the atmosphere of the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that one interesting result of elections of this sort is
that they bring families together, since people are required to vote
where they have housing registration, usually their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 percent said that they had a "rare" family reunion
because of the election, the poll showed.

Republic of China citizens who suffered
injuries from atomic explosions in Japan during World War II are
eligible to apply for living subsidies from the Japanese government,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday.
</P>

"The foreign ministry has asked the Ministry of the Interior and
the Department of Health inform local people of this new regulation
and to urge local victims to file applications with Japanese
authorities as soon as possible," said a foreign ministry official.
</P>
<P>
He said local victims should mail application forms plus
diagnosis certificates and other related documents to the Nagasaki
City Government. Once the Japanese authorities approve the travel
schedule, the applicants can travel to Japan for physical checkups.
The Japanese government will pay for travel and other relevant
expenses.
</P>
<P>
The official further said only the victims themselves are
eligible to apply for the Japanese living subsidies. The next of kin
of those who have died of atomic explosion injuries are not eligible
to apply for the subsidy.
</P>
<P>
It's not clear how many Taiwan people were injured by atomic
bombs dropped by American forces in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August
1945.

KMT DISMISSES REPORTS ABOUT DISBANDING PROTESTERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) denied reports Wednesday that the party will disband the
protesters occupying the square in front of the Presidential Office
after a planned demonstration this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Cheng-yuan made the remarks after KMT Chairman Lien Chan,
who lost by a razor-thin margin to President Chen Shui-bian, who won
another four-year term, in the March 20 presidential election,
presided over the regular weekly KMT Central Standing Committee
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lien instructed related party organizations to plan for the March
27 "fight for justice and save democracy" rally on Ketagalan
Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Lien said that he has been deeply touched by the sight of
thousands of protestors, many of them rotating in shifts, bracing
against days of chilly and damp weather to protest what they claim
was an "unfair" election.
</P>
<P>
The protestors demanded a quick recount of the ballots after Lien
lost by a 0.22 percent margin, or fewer than 30,000 votes, and a full
explanation of what they claim are "suspicious circumstances"
surrounding the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu on the eve of the election, which they believe
gave Chen sympathy votes and victory in the hotly contested election.
</P>
<P>
The crowd has refused to disperse and instead has continued a
generally orderly protest to keep up pressure, even though the
government has already agreed to a recount and has urged the leaders
of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party --
Lien and his running mate, PFP Chairman James Soong -- to take
responsibility for persuading them to leave the usually bustling
thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
As the "pan-blue alliance" is now planning to stage another rally
March 27, reports have said that the KMT would disband the crowd
after the rally, but Tsai said that "this is not true " and added
that for "strategic reasons," the party will keep its options open.
</P>
<P>
Several KMT legislators also expressed their views about the
March 27 rally, with legislators and Central Standing Committee
members Hung Hsiu-chu and Huang Chao-shun saying that they are
willing to stage a sit-in fast.
</P>
<P>
Other KMT Central Standing Committee members said that the whole
party should be mobilized for the rally, while others suggested that
an islandwide journey should be embarked upon to appeal to the
grassroots.
</P>
<P>
KMT Vice Chairman and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said that the
appeal should be expanded to solicit the support of the public views
in the days leading up to the rally, according to Tsai.
</P>
<P>
After March 27, a series of activities should be held around the
island, with KMT officials facing the people to explore the
ramifications of the election, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
Local support groups of the "pan-blue alliance" should also form
committees to become a force in opposing the "unfair" election, Ma
added.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, Ho Ching-he, speaker of the Chiayi
county council, called for civil servants of the KMT to donate one
month's worth of their salaries to buy fruit for the protesters in
Taipei as a gesture of support.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a 25-year-old man surnamed Kuo was arrested when he
moved toward Taipei Mayor Ma in a suspicious manner when Ma was
cheering on the protesters Wednesday afternoon. He was discovered to
be carrying a toy gun, although he claimed that he was at the scene
because of his admiration for Ma.

CANADIAN TEAM INSPECTS PALACE MUSEUM BRANCH CONSTRUCTION SITE
</HEADLINE>

Chiayi,  Taiwan,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A team of senior executives from
Canada's Lord Cultural Resources Planning and Management Inc. made an
inspection tour Wednesday of the planned construction site in Chiayi
County for the southern Taiwan branch of the National Palace Museum.
</P>
<P>
Lord has won the bid to come up with a blueprint for the National
Palace Museum's Chiayi branch and Wednesday's visit marked the first
time that Lord has sent staff to inspect the planned construction
site in southern Taiwan's Taipao City.
</P>
<P>
Chuck Sutyla, Lord's project director and leader of the Canadian
team, said he is impressed by the site's convenient location and the
rich tourist resources in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
Lord has assisted in constructing museums in Saudi Arabia,
Singapore, the Philippines and Chicago. This is the first time the
company has been involved in building a cultural facility in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei is one of the
world's most famous museums, with a huge collection of ancient
Chinese art treasures and antiquities.
</P>
<P>
The museum's southern Taiwan branch is scheduled for inauguration
in 2008. The construction site is near the Taipao station of the
Taiwan high-speed railway, which is scheduled for completion late
next year and will be a major gateway for the new museum.
</P>
<P>
The construction site is close to many tourist attractions in the
Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan region, including the Alishan scenic area, the
Yunlin coastal scenic area and the Peikang Matsu Temple.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Palace Museum's plan, its southern
branch will focus on displaying Asian art objects and on promoting
cultural development in the southern part of the island. The new
museum is also expected to help boost tourist and economic
development in the region.

LIEN RESOLVES TO SEEK TRUTH, WILL NOT EVADE RESPONSIBILITIES: AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan appealed Wednesday for solidarity among the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" and vowed to dig out "the truth" regarding the disputed
March 20 presidential poll and the gunshot suffered by President Chen
Shui-bian on the eve of polling day.
</P>
<P>
Lien was quoted as making the remarks during a weekly meeting of
the KMT's policy-making Central Standing Committee -- the first of
its kind in the wake of the Saturday's presidential poll -- by party
spokesman Tsai Cheng-yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lien lost the race by a very slim margin of less than 30,000
ballots to Chen, who won a second term, prompting Lien to question
the fairness of the election and pushing some of his supporters to
stage a marathon protest in the square in front of the Presidential
Office since late Saturday demanding a recount.
</P>
<P>
The KMT chief filed two lawsuits Saturday immediately after the
preliminary results were announced, demanding an annulment of the
election.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsai, Lien pledged that he will assume full
responsibility for the many difficulties that the "pan-blue alliance"
has encountered and he also expressed his strong belief that "the
public demand must be heeded" and that "justice must be served."
</P>
<P>
Tsai said Lien has said he is not "unable to afford to lose" and
that he favors a quick recount of the votes through an emergency
decree issued by the president rather than by going the legal route
via a revision of the President and Vice President Election and
Recall Law.
</P>
<P>
Lien also requested that no conditions be attached to the recount
and that neutral and prominent figures be invited to monitor the
entire process, Tsai said, adding that his party chairman also
demands an independent panel be set up and comprised of impartial
professionals to investigate Chen's shooting.
</P>
<P>
According to the KMT spokesman, Lien did not make any comments
regarding the possibility of a merger of the "pan-blue alliance"
parties -- the KMT, the People First Party and the New Party.
</P>
<P>
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is also a KMT vice chairman, said
that the KMT will never rescind the two lawsuits and that what he
claimed are "the many suspicious points" surrounding the shooting
must be fully clarified.

PREMIER OUTLINES FOUR PRINCIPLES FOR VOTE RECOUNT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday that a
recount of votes cast in the March 20 presidential election will be
conducted under the principles of "exactness, impartiality,
transparency and legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Yu directed the Central
Election Commission (CEC) to prepare for a possible revision of the
President and Vice President Election and Recall Law to lay a legal
basis for the recount.
</P>
<P>
"As the difference in the number of votes between the winner and
the runner-up was very small, a recount will be conducive to forging
mutual trust between the rival camps and stabilizing society, " Yu
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung said the opposition
"pan-blue alliance's" demand that President Chen Shui-bian issue an
emergency decree to facilitate an immediate recount would destroy the
judicial system, especially as Chen was one of the presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
If the president issued an emergency decree at the request of the
"pan-blue alliance," there would be doubts that a player was doubling
as a referee, Lin explained.
</P>
<P>
Chen and his running mate -- Vice President Annette Lu -- won
their re-election bid by garnering 6,471,970 votes, beating the
"pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his
running mate -- People First Party Chairman James Soong -- by a
razor-thin margin of 0.228 percent.
</P>
<P>
After refusing to accept the election results, Lien filed a
lawsuit to seek the election's annulment and demanded a vote recount.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of "pan-blue alliance" supporters are continuing a
marathon protest in front of the Presidential Office that began
Saturday night against what they called an "unfair election."

PRESIDENT VOWS TO HEAL RIFT IN SOCIETY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
will do whatever he can to "heal the rift" in local society in the
wake of his narrow re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the pledge while meeting with 11 key opinion leaders at
the Presidential Office to seek their advice about how to resolve the
post-election dispute and how to increase social harmony and unity.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he also said he is willing to meet with the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" presidential and vice presidential
candidates -- Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Chen expressed hope that the two opposition leaders
will ask their supporters still demonstrating in front of the
Presidential Office to disperse so that both sides can have a more
"calm, rational and objective" dialogue environment.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Lien-Soong supporters have been protesting outside
the Presidential Office following Chen's re-election last Saturday.
The Lien-Soong camp has alleged that Saturday's election was marred
by irregularities, but has so far presented little evidence to back
their claim.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that the demonstrators have endured hardships,
including chilly drizzle, over the past four days. "I hope the
opposition leaders can persuade their supporters to go home as soon
as possible so that calmness can resume in our society," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the president said he has no intention of making an end to
the demonstration a premise for a meeting with Lien and Soong. In
fact, he said, he has always been willing to meet with the two
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting need not be held inside the Presidential Office. I'm
willing to visit them at a place of their convenience. In addition to
discussing matters related to the election, I also hope to seek their
counsel about a broad range of national affairs and policy issues, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to calm an increasingly divided public, Chen said
the 23 million Taiwan people share a common destiny. "All of us are
masters of this island, regardless of their ethnic origin."
</P>
<P>
During his second term, Chen went on, he will listen to
"different, diverse voices, " particularly opinions from the
opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
"The coming four years mark a new hope. My last election battle
is over. I no longer have 're-election' pressure and I'll work
selflessly for our homeland," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the election-eve assassination attempt against him,
Chen said his brush with death has had an impact on his view of life.
"I'll dedicate myself to service. I'll push for Taiwan's economic
growth and reform in various aspects. I'm the president of the 23
million Taiwan people, not just the president of the 647 million
people who voted for me," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The 11 opinion leaders included Red Cross Society President C.V.
Chen; China Times Group General Manager Huang Chao-sung; noted
writers Bo Yang and Huang Chun-ming; Clean Election Promotion
Association President Tsai Sung-lin; former Taipei Society President
Chu Hai-yuan; Public Television Service Chairman Wu Feng-shan; and
National Policy Adviser Hsiao Hsin-huang.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the meeting, Chen said last Saturday's
presidential vote exposed some of the more serious divisions among
the 23 million people of the country.
</P>
<P>
"How can we unify Taiwan and heal the rifts among the various
ethnic groups?" Chen asked. "I'd like to have your valuable views and
opinions as guidelines for my next four years in office."
</P>
<P>
Before the election, Chen said he had assured Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh, who is also the only Taiwan-born Nobel
laureate, that he will continue carrying out various reform programs
in his second term and give priority to "healing the ethnic rifts."
</P>
<P>
Many of those who are protesting outside the Presidential Office
are what are termed "mainlanders" -- people whose families fled to
Taiwan from mainland China when the communists took over the mainland
in 1949. This group, which comprises only about 15 percent of the
population, have traditionally supported the KMT, whose leader, Lien
Chan, lost Saturday's vote by a slim margin of 0.2 percent, or 29,518
ballots.
</P>
<P>
The core supporters of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party
describe themselves as "native Taiwanese" -- people whose ancestors
migrated to Taiwan from the mainland centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
During the election, the KMT frequently accused Chen of inflaming
the social divisions. The party said Chen unfairly suggested that
Lien was in cahoots with Beijing and would sell out Taiwan if
elected.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has never ruled Taiwan, but claims that the island
belongs to the mainland and must unify eventually or face war.
Beijing despises Chen because he refuses to endorse unification.
</P>
<P>
Chen has argued that his campaign was not divisive. While meeting
with the 11 opinion leaders, Chen said his campaign to strengthen
Taiwan's national identity should not be narrowly interpreted as a
drive to de-sinicization. He further said that in a democratic
country like Taiwan, political parties should compete for voter
support but should refrain from "zero-sum" political wrangling.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT URGED TO SAVE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM PLAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taichung,  March  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cultural and literary circles in
Taichung, central Taiwan urged the central government Wednesday to
retain a plan to build a satellite Guggenheim Museum in Taichung
before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
Since it is crucial that a decision is reached before the end of
March on whether the museum will be set up in Taichung City, members
of Taichung's cultural and literary circles called for help from the
Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said in early February that the dateline
for signing an agreement with the Guggenheim has passed and that if
the city cannot ink the agreement soon by obtaining the trust and the
support of the Guggenheim Museum and overcoming technical problems,
the plan might have to be aborted altogether.
</P>
<P>
It will be pitiful if the plan is aborted, as the museum's
designer -- Iraqi-English architect Zaha Hadid -- has recently been
awarded the 2004 Pritzker Architecture Prize, the world's top
architectural honor, said Huang Chao-hu, a spokesman for the
Guggenheim Museum Promotion Group in Taichung.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Taichung Guggenheim, Hadid also designed such
structures as the free-flowing Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain;
the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati; a tram
station in Strasbourg, France; and a contemporary arts center in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
The first woman to win the Pritzker Architecture Prize, Hadid has
become known for her futuristic masterpieces featuring floating
spaces, geometric patterns and ribbons of concrete.
</P>
<P>
Huang and his group made three emergency calls Wednesday to the
Taichung city government and the central government. They urged Hu
not to give up his strenuous efforts to save the Taichung Guggenheim
plan.
</P>
<P>
If the central government will not allocate NT$5 billion (US$150
million) to support the plan it should take over the matter and in
turn finance the building of a national Taiwan Guggenheim Fine Arts
Museum anywhere in the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
In the event that the Guggenheim plan fails altogether, the
Taichung city council should use the funds that were originally
allocated for building the museum to construct a Taichung City
Contemporary Fine Arts Museum, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hu said later in the day that he has not given up on
the plan and urged the Executive Yuan to make a decision quickly to
foot the NT$5 billion bill and related taxes to facilitate the
realization of the program.

FEWER TAIWAN PASSENGERS USING MACAU AIRPORT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Macau,  March 24 (CNA)
(By  Adam Lee and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of passengers from Taiwan who
used Macau airport last year dropped by 33 percent, reflecting the
largest plunge in traveler numbers on all routes around the world to
the former Portuguese colony's airport since it began operations,
according to statistics released by the Macau authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the tallies, a total of 2.9 million passengers used
the airport in 2003, a drop of about 30 percent compared to the 2002
level.
</P>
<P>
During this year's Chinese new year holiday season in late
January -- which traditionally is a peak travel season for Chinese
people around the world -- Taiwan people paid only about 169,000
visits to Macau, a 1 percent reduction from the number posted in
January of last year, when the annual lunar new year fell in
February.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Macau's aviation industry attributed the decline in
Taiwan passenger numbers using Macau -- a key transfer stop for
Taiwan people heading to or flying from mainland China -- to the
opening last year of an indirect Shanghai-Taipei route via Okinawa.
The source claimed that at least 10 percent of travelers are now
opting for routes other than Macau when they fly between Taiwan and
the mainland.

NO WAY FOR RECOUNT OTHER THAN LAW REVISION: CABINET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The quickest and only way to solve the
controversy in the wake of Saturday's presidential election is to
revise the relevant law to allow for a ballot recount, a Cabinet
spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung made the remarks after a
meeting of the Executive Yuan in which Minister of Justice Chen
Ding-nan, Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Huang Shih-cheng,
Minister without Portfolio Yeh Chun-jung and various others
expressed their views about legal ways to solve the controversy.
</P>
<P>
Lin said that revising the President and Vice President Election
and Recall Law so as to start the legal process for a vote recount is
the only channel through which the problem can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition camp's request that President Chen
Shui-bian issue an emergency decree to allow for an immediate recount
of the ballots is "whimsical" and that the government "can by no
means accept it."
</P>
<P>
Huang, meanwhile, said that if the Legislative Yuan can complete
the revision of the related law Monday, the CEC will be able to
complete all necessary preparations and conduct the recount next
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 25,000 election workers will have to be
mobilized for a recount, while related expenditure still has to be
calculated, he added.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian won re-election by a razor-thin margin
of 0.22 percent, or less than 30,000 votes, against his challenger,
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
Lien has demanded a recount because of the slimness of the
margin and has voiced suspicions over the shooting of Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu on the eve of last Saturday's election, which he
believes gave Chen sympathy votes and victory in the bitterly
contested election.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of invalid ballots cast this year were
more than 11 times that of Chen's margin, Lien's supporters have
pointed out.

DOH TO SPEND US$87.87 BILLION ON TUBERCULOSIS PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In view of the fact that new cases of
tuberculosis continue to rise unabated each year in Taiwan, the
Department of Health (DOH) is preparing to spend NT$2.9 billion
(US$87.87 million) over the next five years on the diagnosis and cure
of sufferers of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Su Yi-jen, director-general of DOH"s Center for Disease Control,
said that among the new cases reported each year, 22 percent are not
tuberculosis but lung cancer cases that have been mis-diagnosed as
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
This shows that in addition to X-ray examinations, a positive
sputum smear test is required to confirm a tuberculosis infection.
</P>
<P>
Chang Shan-chun, director of infectious diseases of the National
Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), said that for a first-time patient
of tuberculosis, the typical symptoms of fever, coughing and weight
loss may not be apparent and even a sputum smear may not be
sufficient for a positive diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
Yang Su-piao, a former NTUH superintendent, said that the quality
and quantity of examiners for sputum smear tests are insufficient,
noting that sputum smear culture tests are very time-consuming and
that a single examiner can only conduct 30 tests a day at most.
</P>
<P>
Responding to their views, Su said that the DOH's five-year
project aims to raise the cure rate of tuberculosis to 87 percent and
lower the mortality rate to less than four out of every 100,000 cases
by 2008.

CONCERNS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED FOR STABILITY: ACADEMIA SINICA HEAD

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government should address all the
concerns about the just-concluded presidential election to clear up
the people's doubts so as to maintain stability in Taiwan society,
the head of the country's top research institute said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tse said that measures,
including a vote recount and investigations into the 11th-hour
assassination attempt against President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu, should be taken immediately to defuse all
doubts and concerns among the people.
</P>
<P>
"If the doubts and concerns are not removed, then it will be
difficult for Taiwan to move forward," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The election turbulence has deeply divided Taiwan society, Lee
said, adding that the rival camps each winning about 50 percent of
the votes is a reality in Taiwan that every member of society must
face.
</P>
<P>
Lee said he had pointed out prior to the March 20 presidential
election that what is important is not who wins the election, but
instead that Taiwan forge ahead.
</P>
<P>
He also said Taiwan's leaders must be humble, accept the fact
that people have different views, and adjust their manner of doing
things accordingly in order to unite the people and create an even
better situation in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu won their
re-election last Saturday by 0.2 percent of the total ballots and
their opponents, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Lien
Chan and James Soong, have alleged vote-rigging and other
irregularities in the election.
</P>
<P>
Having refused to accept the results of the election, the
"pan-blue alliance" supporters continued their sit-in in front of the
Presidential Office that began last Saturday night.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "If a man allows himself to lose
his temper and forget himself of a morning, in such a way as to
become careless for the safety of his own person and for the safety
of his parents and friends -- is that not a case of a great delusion
in life?"

DPP SECRETARY-GENERAL RULES OUT NEW ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unless the Taiwan High Court determines
that the just-concluded presidential election is null and void, there
is no question of holding a new election, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-general Chang Chun-hsiung said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a news conference for foreign journalists, Chang said that
holding a new election from scratch would cause political disturbance
and tarnish the country's image, and is therefore neither a legal nor
a practical option, even though the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
whose candidate lost the election by a slim margin, advocates a new
election.
</P>
<P>
Describing the election as "fair and square, " Chang said anyone
requesting a vote recount should present evidence that irregularities
took place in the vote-counting and ask the prosecutors to intervene.
</P>
<P>
However, Chang went on, in order to settle the dispute, President
Chen Shui-bian -- who won the election -- agreed to a recount
following a revision to the President and Vice President Election and
Recall Law. The DPP's efforts to push through the resolution at the
Legislative Yuan was blocked by the two opposition parties, Chang
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As for the gunshot suffered by Chen during a campaign parade on
the eve of polling day, Chang said the president would agree to the
opposition's request to have the incident probed by an independent
investigation panel to see if it was, as the opposition has claimed,
a complicated political scheme.
</P>
<P>
Actually, as the victim of an assassination attempt, Chang said,
the president is more eager than anyone to find out the truth behind
the incident.
</P>
<P>
A prosecutor-turned DPP lawmaker, Chiu Tai-san disputed the
"pan-blue alliance's" demand for a recount through an emergency
decree from the president, pointing out that an emergency decree
would freeze the people's civil rights and is an irresponsible way to
deal with the dispute.

NO CONSENSUS ON HOW TO REVISE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day before the Legislative Yuan was
slated to discuss the revision of the President and Vice President
Election and Recall Law to pave the way for a recount of the votes in
the March 20 presidential election, consensus among the different
parties over how to do this seemed elusive Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT), whose candidate in the race was
defeated by a slim margin, suggested a recount supervised by the
court as a way to sort out the dispute about whether President Chen
Shui-bian won the election.
</P>
<P>
KMT Legislator Lo Ming-tsai told a news conference at the
Legislative Yuan that a recount by the Central Election Commission
would be inappropriate, as the commission is the organization that
carried out the first controversial vote-count and therefore cannot
be expected to come up with an outcome contrary to its first count.
</P>
<P>
However, the legal process to get a court order for a recount
will take three to six months, which is too long for the problem
facing the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Lo said, his party came up with a recommendation for a
recount presided over by the court, which could appoint independent
people to tally the votes again.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as both a judicial and administrative recount, KMT
lawmaker Huang Teh-fu urged his Democratic Progressive Party
counterparts in the legislature to support the KMT's idea in Friday's
discussion and enact it into law as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Other KMT lawmakers also requested the insertion of a provision
into the current law providing for an independent inquiry into
incidents in which any candidates in the presidential race are killed
or injured.
</P>
<P>
If these incidents were found to be a campaign scheme, the
election would become null and void and a new one would have to be
organized, according to these KMT lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
DPP legislators refused to commit themselves to any course of
action, saying they would have to study the KMT's ideas during
Friday's discussion.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-lang, secretary of the DPP Legislative Yuan caucus,
said his party would accept any proposals put forward by the KMT as
long as they are "reasonable."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the KMT should cancel a planned March 27
protest and persuade its supporters, some of whom are staging a
protest in front of the Presidential Office, to disperse if a
revision is passed Friday.

SINGAPORE PORTS TO COMPLY WITH NEW IMO SECURITY MEASURES: MINISTER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Singaporean Transport Minister Yeo
Cheow Tong said Wednesday that two of Singapore's three ports have
met the requirements regarding the International Maritime
Organization's (IMO's) new security measures.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, which is the world's busiest container port, has been
quick to implement the International Ship and Port Facility Security
Code drawn up by the IMO, he said
</P>
<P>
The deadline for ports to comply with the new IMO security
measures is July 1 this year. Singapore's third port will likely get
its certificate by next week.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to be one of the first countries in the world to be
fully compliant," Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
Among the IMO security measures is the requirement that all ships
above 500 tons be fitted with an automatic identification system.
Singapore is going even further by looking at coming out with a low
cost transponder system for smaller ships. The transponder can
automatically send signals that identify the vessel and its position.

KINMEN MIGHT BECOME CROSS-STRAIT TRANSSHIPMENT PLATFORM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kinmen,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of the Control Yuan called on
the government Thursday to improve the facilities at Kinmen's airport
and to expand its operations so that the outlying island can become a
transshipment platform for maritime and air transport services
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
Chao Jung-yao and Lee Shen-yi, who traveled to Kinmen to inspect
the "mini-three links, " made the appeal after hearing a briefing
delivered by Kinmen county government officials on the county's
administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
The "mini-three links" refers to direct trade, shipping and
postal links between the Republic of China-held outlying islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's ports of Xiamen and Mawei in
Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Chao said that there are still many obstacles to the opening of
direct links between the mainland and Taiwan-proper, so the
government should try to build Kinmen into a transshipment platform
in order to satisfy the public's demand for growing cross-strait
economic, trade and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the existing shipping links with the mainland,
Chao pointed out, the Kinmen airport should be upgraded to allow
cross-strait chartered flight services, which would make it a
transport hub for passengers traveling between Taiwan and the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal can be put into practice, it will give a boost to
Kinmen's economic development, he added.

OFFICIAL CALLS FOR PREFERENTIAL STEEL PRICES FOR DOMESTIC CONSUMERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  25 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Due to a global shortfall in steel
production, supply and demand will not be balanced within the next
three to five years and prices are unlikely to drop, an official of
the Taiwan Steel and Iron Industries Association (TSIIA) said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
TSIIA Secretary-general Wu Shang-feng said that because of a
recent surge in steel prices, China Steel Corporation -- Taiwan's
largest steelmaker -- and other domestic steelmakers should supply
steel and iron to domestic buyers at prices lower than those for
foreign buyers so that the domestic users can remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
He added that domestic steel consumers have urged financial
institutions to ease financing restrictions and are pushing
steelmakers to increase production to meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
Hwang Weng-sing, president of Metal Industries Research &amp;
Development Center, said that the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and the
2010 Shanghai Expo have allowed mainland China emerge as a major
factor in the fluctuating global steel prices.
</P>
<P>
Although prices will continue to fluctuate in the short term, he
said, they will increase steadily in the long term. Even though the
mainland's demand for steel will decline after 2010, India's rapid
development will create further high demand, Huang went on

GOVERNMENT MUST BE HUMBLE, BUILD HARMONY: PREMIER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government will learn to be more
humble to heed public demand and forge harmony in society under the
leadership of President Chen Shui-bian in the coming four years,
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks during a citation ceremony for prominent
youths from colleges and universities around Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Stating that Chen will continue to lead the country for another
four years after succeeding in Saturday's re-election bid, Yu said
that the government will be given a new chance to serve the Taiwan
people, and will this time be more humble and lend greater respect to
public opinion, in order to repair the ethnic rift in the country.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for widespread support from the younger
generation for the government's efforts to continue carrying out
reforms in a broad range of areas.
</P>
<P>
The efforts to improve Taiwan's investment climate, promote
high-tech businesses and speed up infrastructure construction have
paid off, evident in that the ranking of Taiwan's global
competitiveness has noticeably moved up thanks to a more
comprehensive traffic network, remarkable financial reform and a
stronger high-tech sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen, the candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
won the March 20 presidential election by a very slim margin of 0.228
percent over opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan -- the
sole challenger fielded by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" formed
by the KMT, the People First Party and the New Party.

JAPAN URGED TO UPGRADE EXCHANGES WITH TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese government, while seeking to
strengthen cooperation with mainland China, should also review its
relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and upgrade bilateral
exchanges, a senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hsu Shui-teh, president of the Association for East-Asian
Relations (AEAR), made the appeal in a speech delivered at a seminar
on East Asia and mainland China affairs. The AEAR is a quasi-official
body authorized by the ROC government to handle relations with Japan
in the absence of diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Hsu, who once served as the ROC representative to Japan, said he
hopes the two countries will have more high-level exchanges to boost
cooperation in cultural, academic, economic, technological and
regional security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Taiwan has evolved from an authoritarian rule to
one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia, Hsu said, the Japanese
government should raise the levels of its officials to be allowed to
visit Taiwan and should also grant visas to top ROC leaders for
visits to Japan.
</P>
<P>
For fears of offending Beijing, Japan has refrained from
high-level engagements with Taiwan. Since Japan switched diplomatic
recognition to Beijing in 1972, only low- or middle-ranking Japanese
official have been allowed to visit Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said this situation should be changed. "We hope Japanese
authorities will ease restrictions on engagements with Taiwan
to pave the way for closer bilateral cooperation in promoting
regional prosperity, security and stability."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hsu said, Taiwan and Japan should sign a free
trade agreement to facilitate further growth in bilateral trade,
investment and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In view of mainland China's rise as an economic and military
power, Hsu said Taiwan and Japan should also forge a viable mechanism
for dialogue and cooperation in security and defense affairs.
</P>
<P>
Hsu further urged Japan to support Taiwan's bid to join
non-political functional international organizations, such as the
World Health Organization (WHO), so that Taiwan can contribute more
to the international society.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda once expressed
support for Taiwan's participation in the WHO as an observer. We hope
the Japanese government can do more to help Taiwan realize this
goal," Hsu said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar is being organized by the Institute of
International Relations of National Chengchi University. The
seminar brings together more than 100 scholars and experts, including
20 Japanese delegates, to discuss the latest developments in mainland
China and their possible impact on the general East Asian
situation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, Takao Fujii, a Japanese
lawmaker, echoed Hsu's views, saying that Taiwan and Japan should
seek a common defense strategy for mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
Fujii, who is also a leading figure of a pro-Taiwan group in the
lower house of the Japanese Diet (or parliament), said that in
the geopolitical sense, Taiwan and Japan have traditionally enjoyed a
very close relationship.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the people of Taiwan and Japan make more
than 1.5 million visits to each other's country every year and Japan
enjoys a trade surplus of US$20 billion with Taiwan every year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Fujii said, Japan relies heavily on safe passage
through the Taiwan Strait, which is the lifeline of Japan's economy
at sea. "Against this backdrop, cross-strait political stability is
the best security for Japan," he said, adding that Taiwan and
Japan should jointly seek a strategy that will benefit both
countries.

TAIWAN TEXTILE INDUSTRY KEEN ON DESIGN, DIVERSIFICATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Hong Kong,  March  25 (CNA)
(By S.M. Chen and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's textile industry will be
dedicated to product design and manufacturing upgrading in order to
take maximum advantage of a global market free of quota restrictions
in 2005, Taiwan Textile Federation Secretary General Huang Wei-chi
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Giving a keynote speech about the latest trends in Taiwan's
textile industry at Hong Kong's "Interest of Asia" spring exhibition,
Huang said the industry has shifted from labor-intensive to
diversified business, ranging from up-stream man-made fibers to
down-stream garment making.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, Taiwan textile companies have transformed
themselves from original equipment makers to original design makers
capable of providing a comprehensive production line, coupled with
processing facilities in other countries, for customers from around
the world wishing to grab a larger market share.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a majority of Taiwan fabric producers have
relocated to mainland China, with the rest moving out to Thailand,
Vietnam and countries in Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan-made products are today lauded as high-end
goods in the international market, he said many businesses are fully
aware of the fact that continued innovation and development in
quality, design, materials and function are their best weapons to
maintain an impressive presence in the world marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Output of Taiwan-made polyester totaled more than 1 million
metric tons last year, the highest level in the world, Huang added.

PRESIDENT TO PRIORITIZE TAIWAN UNIFICATION, STABLE CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
that unifying Taiwan, stabilizing cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
promoting constitutional reform and reinvigorating the economy will
top his work agenda for the coming four years.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of business
executives, human rights activists and aboriginal representatives at
the Presidential Office to exchange views on his administration's
plans.
</P>
<P>
First of all, Chen said, he will begin mending relations with
mainland China, a task that he said will be easier in a second term
unencumbered by re-election pressures.
</P>
<P>
As the first step in honoring this campaign promise, Chen said he
will meet with Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh Friday to
discuss the formation of a special task force to mull feasible
measures to improve cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
This task force will be composed of government officials,
academics and business executives, Chen said, adding that the panel
will prepare strategies for negotiations with Beijing for the
establishment of a viable framework for peaceful cross-strait
interaction.
</P>
<P>
During the presidential campaign, Chen adopted a confrontational
stance with the mainland -- Taiwan's biggest security threat. His
critics have speculated that the president will take an even harder
line against the mainland during his second term, a notion Chen
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
"The March 20 election was my last election battle and now I have
a freer hand to do things," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Taiwan wants to make peace with the mainland, Chen
said his administration will make every possible effort to forge
cross-strait rapprochement under the cardinal principle of "peace."
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that it will be no easy task to thaw the
long-stalled cross-strait relations. "Because it is very difficult,
I'll make all-out efforts to achieve a breakthrough in this regard, "
he added.
</P>
<P>
Turning to domestic affairs, Chen reaffirmed his commitment to
pushing for constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
"Our existing constitution is outdated and fails to meet Taiwan's
present situation. We should face up to this reality. The key point
of our reform is not aimed at addressing the thorny independence or
unification issue. Our top goal is to upgrade government efficiency
and national competitiveness, " Chen explained, adding that the
underlying principle of his constitutional reform programs is that
Taiwan's present status quo should not be changed.
</P>
<P>
Those present at the meeting included Morris Chang, chairman of
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.; Barry Lam, chairman of
Quanta Co.; Nita Ing, chairwoman of the Taiwan High-Speed Railway
Co.; Huang Mao-hsiung, chairman of the Chinese National Association
of Industry and Commerce; and aboriginal Legislator Walis Pelin.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the post-election dispute with the opposition, Chen
said he will not rule out "political means" to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Chen's slim re-election victory is being contested by his
challenger, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, who claims that the
voting was marred by irregularities and an unsolved election-eve
shooting that slightly wounded the president.
</P>
<P>
Although Lien has provided little specific evidence of wrongdoing
in Saturday's election, large crowds of his supporters have rallied
in front of the Presidential Office daily, at first demanding a
recount and more recently calling for an entirely new election.
</P>
<P>
Chen assured his guests that his administration will resolve the
dispute in line with the principles of listening to the opposition
camp's opinions, understanding the feelings of the defeated contender
and his supporters, following the guidelines of rule of law and
promoting domestic unity and harmony.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Chen suggested two options for resolving the dispute.
The first would be that the ruling and opposition parties negotiate
mutually acceptable terms and appoint credible judges to recount the
ballots. Another would be to revise the law to allow for people other
than judges and prosecutors to examine the ballots.
</P>
<P>
Chen said he still feels that these two options are the most
appropriate ways to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"After I won the 2000 presidential election with slightly more
than 39 percent of the vote, some people called me a 'minority
president.' This time, I won 50.1 percent of the vote. I believe the
circumstances I face today will not be more difficult than before, "
Chen said confidently.
</P>
<P>
He further said the election-eve shooting has had a strong impact
on his view of life. "I'm determined to work selflessly for our
country. I'll be the president of 23 million people. Although some
people didn't vote for me, they are masters of this island, too. I'll
think about how to win their hearts and minds with my sincerity and
devoted service. This is my mission."
</P>
<P>
Chen said he will recruit more talented, capable people to join
his administration. "Professionalism, integrity and world vision will
be major concerns in manpower recruitment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chen said he will continue to carry out the 10 new
major construction projects as well as promote legislative reform,
economic reform, social reform and educational reform to live up to
the general public's expectations.
</P>
<P>
For the fifth straight day, a large crowd of Lien's supporters
blocked a boulevard in front of the Presidential Office. Hundreds
have been gathering in the morning, and by the evening, the crowd has
been swelling to thousands as people join after work and school.
</P>
<P>
When the demonstration started Sunday morning, the protesters
chanted "We want a recount!" But after President Chen agreed to a
recount and proposed a law revision that would allow a retally by next
week, the protesters changed their chant to "Hold the vote again!"
</P>
<P>
Lien hasn't clearly expressed his views on the re-vote issue, but
Chen's ruling Democratic Progressive Party argued that there were no
legal grounds for the move now.
</P>
<P>
So far, the opposition's position on the election controversy has
been confused, and it has been constantly changing. The opposition
appears to be struggling to reach a consensus between the two
parties in its coalition: the KMT and the smaller People
First Party.

PREMIER URGES OPPOSITION CAMP TO DECIDE ON LEGAL RECOURSE FOR RECOUNT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun urged the opposition
"pan-blue" camp Thursday to come up with a final decision on which
way they will ask for a vote recount of the disputed March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Yu called on main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan -- the
"pan-blue alliance" presidential candidate who lodged two lawsuits
late last Saturday demanding an annulment of the election and a vote
recount immediately after the results showed that he was edged out by
President Chen Shui-bian by a very thin margin -- to decide which
legal means he will demand a recount.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, the "pan-blue alliance" has asked for an
administrative recount through a revision to the President and Vice
President Election and Recall Law, a judicial recount through court
action and a recount through an emergency decree issued by the
president.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Lien's demand that the Central Election Commission
postpone the announcement of the names of the Republic of China's
11th-term president-elect and vice president-elect and allow a fresh
vote, the premier said the court will have the final say as to
whether the March 20 president election is invalid.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of supports of the "pan-blue alliance" presidential
ticket formed by Lien and People First Party Chairman James Soong
have being staging a marathon demonstration in the square in front of
the Presidential Office since late Saturday to protest what they
called an unfair and fraudulent election.

COA TO EXPAND  STRAY DOG STERILIZATION PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Council of Agriculture (COA) announced
Thursday that it is expanding the stray dog sterilization project.
</P>
<P>
COA officials said that the COA is targeting the sterilization of
2,000 female dogs and 1,000 male dogs this year, hoping to stem their
reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Cutting the number of stray dogs has been a nagging headache for
the COA and local governments for years, the officials said, and the
COA began the sterilization project in 2003 on a trial basis, giving
operations to 528 male dogs and 982 female dogs.
</P>
<P>
"With the good results last year, the COA has decided to further
expand the project," they said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that many volunteers in private animal
shelters have long taken care of stray dogs, but as theses shelters
often don't have enough funds and cannot afford to pay for the
sterilizations, the number of stray dogs has in fact continued to
increase, making it more difficult financially for the shelters.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the COA will commission an association of
veterinarians to carry out the sterilization project, and that all
registered animal protection groups can apply for subsidies from the
association. More information is available at (02) 2339-0220.

TAIWAN, JAPAN URGED TO FIND COMMON STRATEGY FOR MUTUAL BENEFITS

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan and Japan have a close relationship
and they must seek a common strategy that will benefit both
countries, a visiting Japanese parliamentarian said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Takao Fujii, who is also a key member of a pro-Taiwan
parliamentary group, made the remarks when he attended the 31st
Taiwan-Japan seminar on mainland China in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar sponsored by the Institute of International
Relations of National Chengchi University is centered on " the
situation of the mainland and East Asia in 2004." More than 100
scholars and experts, including more than 20 Japanese delegates led by
Kunihiko Takano, president of the Association of Mainland Chinese
Affairs, attended the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Fujii said that the people of Taiwan and Japan make more than
1.5 million visits to each other's country every year and that Japan
enjoys a trade surplus of US$20 billion with Taiwan every year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Japan relies heavily on safe passage through the
Taiwan Strait, which is the lifeline of Japan's economy at sea, so
that cross-strait political stability is the best security for Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the geopolitical sense, Japan and Taiwan have
very close relations, and they should jointly seek a strategy that
will benefit both countries. Japan should also work harder to help
Taiwan's bid to join international organizations.
</P>
<P>
He also said that when thinking about future Taiwan-Japan
relations, both sides should not pursue a quick result; rather, they
should consider the other side as an important neighbor and increase
bilateral understanding.
</P>
<P>
Fujii also said that mainland China has posted a high yearly
economic growth rate between 7 percent and 13 percent over the past
decade, and that businesses will naturally want to seek their future
on the mainland, which he said is an unstoppable trend.
</P>
<P>
But he said that mainland China has become unable to handle its
increased energy needs, and that Japanese businesses investing in the
mainland have to deal with power outages. Big cities in the mainland
also face the problem of not having a steady water supply, he said,
adding that if the mainland continues to develop at its current rate,
water and energy resources will be crucial.

U.S. NOT INVOLVED IN POST-ELECTION DISPUTES: FOREIGN MINISTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
The United States is not involved in the
post-election disputes in Taiwan, an official of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Victor J. Chin, director of the foreign ministry's Department of
North American Affairs, said that it is the long-standing stance of
the United States not to get involved in the internal affairs of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department issued a statement Saturday
congratulating the conclusion of Taiwan's March 20 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
"The United States congratulates the people of Taiwan for having
conducted a democratic election campaign and for having exercised
their democratic voting right in such large numbers, " the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"We note that the Central Election Commission has declared that
the 'pan-greens' have won by a very narrow margin. We are aware that
the 'pan-blue alliance' has raised questions about the results.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that both sides and their supporters will
remain calm and that they will use the established legal mechanism to
resolve any questions about the election results," it said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chin said that the United States has yet to issue an
official comment on the outcome of the referendum vote, which was
held alongside the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Both questions in the referendum -- whether to increase Taiwan's
anti-missile defense if Beijing does not withdraw the ballistic
missiles aimed at the island, and whether to establish a framework
for opening cross-strait talks -- failed to be declared valid because
less than half of the more than 16 million eligible voters took part
in the voting. Of those who did participate, over 90 percent answered
"yes" to both questions.
</P>
<P>
Chin said that election experts and academics from the United
States who observed the voting process said they were very much
impressed by the democratic election and are watching closely the
development of the post-election disputes.

Taipei City Government's Bureau of Labor
Affairs is providing bilingual handbooks to help the more than 20,000
foreign caregivers in Taipei in taking care of seriously ill
patients.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials said that the "House Maid Care Handbook" is
available in three different versions -- Chinese-English,
Chinese-Vietnamese and Chinese-Indonesian.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 32,000 foreign laborers in Taipei, of which
nearly 80 percent are caregivers, the officials said. They noted
that although some of the foreign caregivers received training prior
to coming to Taiwan, most of them are not completely familiar with
care giving work.
</P>
<P>
The officials also noted that misunderstandings and quarrels
sometimes erupt because of communication problems resulting from
language barriers. The bureau therefore had invited Cheng Shin
Rehabilitation Medical Center and its volunteer team to provide
relevant information on how to provide basic care, such as extract
mucus, clean body, and train to defecate alone.
</P>
<P>
The center has published 5,000 Chinese-Indonesia handbooks, 2,500
Chinese-English handbooks and 2,500 Chinese-Indonesian handbooks.
</P>
<P>
Those interested in obtaining a copy of the handbook can go to
the Bureau of Foreign Affairs' consultation center for foreign
laborers located at No. 2, Lane 101, Sec. 2, Shinsheng North Road, or

TOP SARS COORDINATOR PRESIDES LAUNCH OF URBANI BIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Rome,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Tony Fang and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top coordinator in Taiwan's campaign
against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) , Lee Ming-liang,
presided over Thursday a ceremony marking the launch of the
Italian-language biography of Carlo Urbani who was the first person
to identify the SARS virus.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Urbani, a World Health Organization communicable disease
expert, died of the flu-like atypical pneumonia in Bangkok on March
29, 2003. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
The Carlo Urbani biography, authored by Italian prize-winning
writer Lucia Bellaspiga, gives a detailed and human account of how
Urbani contributed his professional expertise to SARS identification
and treatment in Asia and how he fought against the deadly virus
during the crucial days prior to his death.
</P>
<P>
Lee, a former minister of Taiwan's Department of Health and
chairman of the Carlo Urbani Memorial Foundation established in
Taiwan last July in memory of the Italian doctor, said the
Chinese-version of the Urbani biography is expected to be published
in Taiwan shortly.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the biography debut ceremony held at Rome's Capital
Museum, Lee said that the book will provide great inspiration to the
younger generations around the world and that the Chinese-version
will let the vast population in the Chinese-speaking communities
learn about Dr. Urbani's spirits and teaching.
</P>
<P>
Lee also shared with the guests how and why the Carlo Urbani
memorial foundation was established in Taiwan. He said that Taiwan's
Executive Yuan decided in July 2003 to use the more than NT$330
million (US$9.56 million) in private donations it collected during
the SARS outbreak to set up a memorial foundation, with Lee serving
as its chairman.
</P>
<P>
During their first meeting, the directors of the foundation
decided that the funds would be used in prevention and relief efforts
against SARS and any other new communicable diseases, as well as in
conducting international exchanges, according to Lee.
</P>
<P>
To stress that Urbani's humanitarian spirit and medical treatment
know no borders, the foundation decided to publish Urbani's biography
in Chinese and English, as well as the biographies of those people in
Taiwan who displayed the same spirit and those who gave up their
lives in the fight against SARS.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the foundation also decided to actively establish
contact with the Urbani Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, for
discussions on matters of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On hand at the biography launching were a number of government
officials and leaders in the medical and literary circles in Italy,
including Mirko Tremaglia, minister of the World and Overseas Italian
Affairs, and Urbani's wife.
</P>
<P>
A written message from Rome's Mayor Walter Veltroni was read at
the launching ceremony. In the message, Veltroni offered his respects
to Urbani and sympathy to Urbani's family.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-version of the Urbani biography, expected to be
published soon, was translated by Ku Kuei-ying, a leader in the
Chinese community in Italy, who has great attainments in both Italian
and Chinese languages.
</P>
<P>
SARS, the atypical flu believed to have originated in the
southern mainland Chinese province of Guangdong in late 2002, spread
to Taiwan in early 2003 and claimed the lives of 37 people before the
island was declared SARS-free in June last year.

NEXT 20 YEARS TO BE FASCINATING FOR SINGAPORE: SENIOR MINISTER LEE

Singapore,  March 26 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
said he believes the next 20 years or so will be fascinating for
Singapore, given the changed outlook of the people and the
experiences they have undergone.
</P>
<P>
Important, too, will be developments and opportunities in an
economically more dominant mainland China -- something which
Singapore must also take advantage of, Lee said in an interview with
the BBC's East Asia Today current affairs program which was conducted
March 17 and broadcast Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Asked about what he thought lies ahead for Singapore, Lee said
that barring any unforeseen shocks such as terrorist acts, the
economy should grow by 3 percent to 5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
As to developments on the social front in Singapore, he said he
believes "it's going to be a fascinating period because in the last
20 years, we've become so cosmopolitan in our outlook."
</P>
<P>
Singapore society used to be "very Asian Chinese-Confucianist, "
he said, adding that this has changed because of the use of English,
the exposure that television and the Internet have brought, and the
fact that Singaporeans travel extensively and interact with tourists
who visit Singapore.
</P>
<P>
On the topic of mainland China, Lee described the process of
change there as being "one of the world's greatest transformations."

Taiwan's representative office in
Bangladesh continues to operate normally, an official of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Sung-huan, director-general of the foreign ministry's

Lin described the reports as untrue. He said that Taiwan's

He declined to comment on whether or not the office has issued

Turning to reports that linked the recent resignation of

<TEXT>
<P>
Initial Legislative Yuan discussions of a
possible revision of the President and Vice President Election and
Recall Law broke down Friday.
</P>
<P>
There are at least four versions of revision proposals, including
one jointly offered by the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
The fruitless negotiations among different parties prompted the
KMT and PFP to accuse the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
of foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
The DPP convener at the legislature, Legislator Ker Chien-ming,
blamed the two opposition parties for being capricious in their
opinions and said their latest proposal is nothing more than a plan
to ensure that their candidates in the race would win regardless.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jin-pyng, the president of the legislature, called a recess
at 5.30 p.m. and said that negotiations will continue next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP were eager to have the law revised in their own
way so that they could request a recount of the votes of the March 20
presidential election, in which their candidate lost by 29,518 votes
out of over 13 million cast.

Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou laid down the

Saturday will be considered illegal and a team of over 5,000 police

DR. HENRY LEE TO BE INVITED TO JOIN PROBE INTO ELECTION-EVE SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Henry Lee, a world-renowned
Chinese-American forensic expert, will be invited to join an
independent forensic panel to probe into the election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian, the nation's top prosecutor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa said the proposed
independent panel under the State Public Prosecutor General's Office
(SPPGO) will assist the investigative task force formed by the
prosecution and police authorities in the southern city of Tainan in
solving the failed assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
Lu stressed that the SPPGO forensic panel's work will not
conflict with the Criminal Investigation Bureau's (CIB's) forensic
examinations.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, Lee has agreed to travel to
Taiwan in April to assist in investigating the unsolved shooting
which slightly wounded President Chen and allegedly helped propel him
to the narrowest of election victories.
</P>
<P>
Lu said he has yet to get in touch with Lee. "But I think it
won't be a problem for Lee to come to Taiwan next week to join the
investigative work."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lu said Shih Tai-ping, a former director of the CIB's
forensic department, has agreed to join the SPPGO panel. Shih is
currently attending a meeting in the United States. "He has accepted
my invitation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lu said the SPPGO will respect the two famous forensic experts'
opinions in deciding the roster of the special panel as well as its
investigative direction and operational guidelines. "Lee and Shih are
expected to map out work rules after discussions with the existing
investigative panel."
</P>
<P>
Lu said he hopes that the participation of the two experts will
help enhance the defeated presidential candidate's trust in the
government's determination to solve the case and stop the
post-election controversy.
</P>
<P>
The defeated electoral team of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong claimed that
the shooting unfairly swayed sympathy votes Chen's way. Their
supporters even claimed that the shooting was staged to boost Chen's
re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
Although the Lien-Soong team has provided little specific
evidence of wrongdoing in last Saturday's election, large crowds of
his supporters have rallied in front of the Presidential Office for
the past six days, at first demanding a recount and more recently an
entirely new election.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, CIB investigators said they are seeking a
bald man who was caught on a security camera as he ran from the
scene of last week's assassination attempt against President Chen.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was the first real lead since the shooting
last Friday in Tainan. Chen and Vice President Lu were driving
through the city on the last day of campaigning when the shooting
took palce.
</P>
<P>
The video footage, which is unclear, appears to show a bald man
in his 40s or 50s dressed in a yellow jacket and blue trousers
running down a nearby alley within minutes of the shooting, police
said.
</P>
<P>
"We find the fact that he was running away from the scene of the
crime suspicious," said Deputy CIB Director Wang Wen-chung.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the footage showed the man running away from the main
road where crowds had gathered to cheer the president's motorcade,
just three minutes after police believe the shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
It was given to police by the neighbourhood chief of that section
of Tainan on Wednesday, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"We urge this man or anyone who saw him or may know him to
contact us and clear this up," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Police say Chen and Lu, riding in an open-top jeep, were
each shot with one bullet believed to have been fired from the
same homemade gun.
</P>
<P>
Investigators are focusing their hunt for the would-be
assassin on underground factories that make homemade guns for
use by the Taiwan underworld by altering the firing mechanisms
of toy replicas.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS CALL FOR STABILITY AFTER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Religious leaders called for social
stability Friday due to an ongoing mass protest being held in Taipei
over last Saturday's presidential election result and urged the
government to serve justice and fairness by removing all the doubts
of the people.
</P>
<P>
Paul Cardinal S. J. and Zen Master Sheng Yen, founder of the
Taiwan Buddhist Group Dharma Drum Mountain Social Welfare and Charity
Foundation, made the call in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"The government must make justice be fully served, while the
opposition camp must remain peaceful for the sake of social stability
and national prosperity," they said.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their hope that the public would stay calm and
face the situation rationally and they urged the government to come
up with an effective and clear-cut solution to settle the current
problem.
</P>
<P>
Stating that all the Taiwan's ethnic groups, regardless of their
religion or ethnicity, should try to respect each other and learn
something positive from others, they said that all the people living
in Taiwan are members of a big family, who should pursue the common
interests of all society and seek justice and peace with forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
have being staged a marathon demonstration in the square in front of
the Presidential Office since late Saturday to protest the
presidential election result. They called the election "unfair" and
"fraudulent" and have demanded a recount.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan of the "pan-blue
alliance" was edged out by incumbent President Chen Shui-bian by a
very slim margin of 0.228 percent, or fewer than 30,000 ballots out
of a total of more than 13 million votes cast.

TRAVEL WEB SITES  DRIVING FORCE BEHIND B2C E-TRADE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travel Web sites are the major driving
force behind Taiwan's business-to-customer e-commerce, injecting an
annual production worth of NT$10.6 billion (US$316.5 million), or 48
percent of Taiwan's total B2C e-trade value last year, the results of
a market survey made public Friday showed.
</P>
<P>
InsightXplorer Corp., a marketing research company based in
Taipei that carried out the survey, said the handsome business
opportunities generated by the travel Web sites have enticed many
business groups into the market.
</P>
<P>
Mergers, acquisitions and consolidations were hotly conducted
last year amid a fierce fight to seize a greater market share of the
B2C e-commerce, InsightXplorer said.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey results, the cyber population paid a
total of more than four million visits to travel Web sites during the
period from December last year to January this year, with
eztravel.com.tw, ezfly.com.tw and startravel.com.tw enjoying the
greatest popularity.
</P>
<P>
Although price, quality and service are the key elements to the
survival of an online travel agency, InsightXplorer warned that a
robust price war is very likely to destroy a balance between the
traditional "brick" and online "virtual" travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
A successful combination of the two forms of travel businesses is
capable of creating mutual benefits, while a failure to do this will
have a negative impact on the whole industry.
</P>
<P>
For instance, liontravel.com.tw -- a creation of Lion Travel
Agency and the PChome portal Web site -- has attracted a total of
540,000 online visitors since its operations began, accounting for
more than 90 percent of the visitors' numbers who have bruised the
Web site run solely by the travel agency.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the spring peak season is almost coming to
an end, efforts made by some online operators to promote special
economic tours have been noticeable. The number of visitors to
liontravel. com. tw increased by 130,000 in February compared to its
January level.
</P>
<P>
As cyber travel agencies must be more competitive than the
traditional "brick" travel agencies to lure customers, those online
tourist agencies should do their best to provide high quality
services, including offering trips designed by customers themselves,
InsightXplorer said.

PREMIER CONDEMNS VIOLENCE AT CENTRAL ELECTION COMMISSION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun condemned the violence
at the Central Election Commission's (CEC) offices Friday, and urged
the leaders of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" to "rein themselves
in from the brink of a precipice."
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks after supporters of the "pan-blue
alliance, " who had gathered outside the Central Election Commission
(CEC) to try to prevent the CEC from formally announcing the
presidential and vice presidential winners from the March 20
election, clashed with police and stormed the building.
</P>
<P>
The CEC later officially confirmed the re-election of President
Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
The premier was meeting with Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou to learn
about the city's preparations for the March 27 mass rally called by
the "pan-blue alliance" comprised of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) and to discuss the situation regarding
information on the rally gathered by the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's planned 500,000-strong rally in front of the
Presidential Office is asking supporters to "let justice be done and
democracy be saved" to protest what it perceives as the "unfair
election" that saw President Chen win another four-year term by a
razor-thin margin of fewer than 30,000 votes against his rival, KMT
Chairman Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that after the violence at the CEC, the
government "finds it difficult to be optimistic about the mass rally
Saturday."
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet condemned the violence at the CEC, Yu said, adding
that, "Politicians who take the people to the streets should, based
on their consciences, take them away according to the law."
</P>
<P>
He urged Lien and PFP Chairman James Soong to "rein themselves in
before the brink of a precipice, " and "not to satisfy their own
selfish ends at the expense of social stability and the nation's
international image."
</P>
<P>
An official of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also
condemned the use of violence at the CEC.
</P>
<P>
Lee Ying-yuan, DPP deputy secretary-general, said that according
to the law, after the March 20 election, the CEC is required to
officially announce the presidential and vice presidential winners
within seven days. Though it is only a formality, the CEC has to act
according to the law, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the protestors have other views about the outcome
of the election, they can use legal means to voice their grievances
by filing suit.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of whether we are talking about the ruling party or
an opposition political party, everyone has the chance to take the
helm of the nation; there will also be a winner and a loser in any
election, so it should not be taken so seriously," Lee added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the DPP has responded positively to "pan-blue
alliance" requests for a ballot recount and to participate in an ad
hoc committee to investigate the shooting of President Chen on the
eve of the election, which may have given Chen sympathy votes and
could have made the difference in his victory in the bitterly
contested election.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for the 'pan-blue alliance' to continue to
hurt Taiwan at the expense of the harmony of society, " Lee stressed.
</P>
<P>
Protesters started to gather outside the CEC building at noon to
protest against a CEC afternoon meeting where commission members
were reviewing the outcome of the election to formally announce the
presidential and vice presidential elects.
</P>
<P>
The angry protestors smashed the glass out of a bulletin board
and posted the words "suspension of the announcement of the elects
before the truth is known."
</P>
<P>
The protestors continued to shout "no announcement before the
recount of the ballots." PFP legislators Lee Chin-hua and Chiu Yi, as
well as a CEC member tried to communicate with them to no avail.
</P>
<P>
At around 4:30 p.m., several agitated protestors shouted "go" and
a large crowd tried to storm the first floor of the building where
the CEC was holding a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sticks, rocks and eggs were thrown and the glass doors were
smashed despite a large number of police.
</P>
<P>
Several people were injured in the melee, and others were trying
to make another attempt to enter the building when the two
legislators and others managed to calm the crowd somewhat.

DENGUE FEVER PREVENTION MECHANISM ACTIVATED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Health (DOH) announced
Friday that the nation's dengue fever prevention mechanism has been
activated amid outbreaks of the disease in Indonesia and other
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the mechanism, DOH officials said, arrivals from Southeast
Asia who have developed a fever will undergo blood tests and be
presented with free mosquito nets for use at home for a week. Dengue
fever is a mosquito-transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the DOH also invited officials from the Tourism
Bureau, the Civil Aeronautics Administration, the Immigration Bureau,
the Council of Labor Affairs, the Environmental Protection Bureau,
health bureaus from 25 cities and counties around the country and
major travel associations to discuss dengue fever-prevention
measures.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the meeting that films featuring dengue fever
prevention and control measures will be shown on all flights from and
to Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
At least 455 people have died from dengue fever in Indonesia so
far this year, DOH officials said. According to the officials, Taiwan
has not had a locally originated dengue fever case so far this year,
but has tallied 17 imported cases, including seven from Indonesia,
six from Vietnam, two from the Philippines, one each from Thailand
and India.
</P>
<P>
DOH officials urged local people intending to visit Southeast
Asia to keep vigilant against contracting the disease.
</P>
<P>
Employers of Southeast Asian caregivers and laborers should also
keep alert about health conditions of their employees, the officials
said. If their employees develop a fever, skin rashes or aches within
two weeks after returning from their home countries, employers should
report the cases to health authorities and assist their employees in
seeking medical treatment.

KMT-PFP PUT FORTH REVISION PLAN FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LAW
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) jointly put forth a plan at the Legislative Yuan
Friday aimed at revising the President and Vice President Election
and Recall Law.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the two parties propose that presidential
candidates can ask the court to seize the ballots, lists of voters
and other election-related documents in case the margin between the
leader and the runner up in the race is less than 1 percent of the
ballots counted as valid. The request can be made before the Central
Election Commission (CEC) formally announces the winner.
</P>
<P>
The high court in the capital should re-examine in public the
ballots and documents within seven days of receiving the request and
should finish the recount of the ballots within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The CEC should not announce the winner before the legal process
is complete and the CEC should withdraw its initial announcement of
the election outcome if it conflicts with the recount and should
announce the winner according to the court's recount.
</P>
<P>
Notable in the proposal is a request for the formation of an
investigation committee to look into the assassination attempt on
President Chen Shui-bian on the eve of the March 20 presidential
election. The two opposition parties suspect the assassination
attempt to be a political ploy designed to help Chen win the
election.
</P>
<P>
The investigation committee should come up with a report on the
incident within one month.
</P>
<P>
To prevent any future such incidents from influencing the results
of presidential elections, the two parties propose that a committee
under the Legislative Yuan be set up to look into any case taking
place within seven days before polling day in which any candidate is
killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
In such cases, the election can be put on hold and resumed only
one month after the investigation committee comes up with a report.
</P>
<P>
Police and armed forces who are on duty during the election
because of the higher alert the country is put on in such cases,
should be allowed to cast their votes after they come off duty,
according to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Most important of all, the revision, if passed, should be applied
retroactively to the March 20 election, according to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party had yet to
respond to the proposal, but Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan
immediately criticized the idea, pointing out that forming an
investigation committee under the legislature would constitute
interference in the power of the judiciary and would undermine the
administration's credibility.

PRESIDENT HOPES MASS RALLY CAN BE HELD IN RATIONAL WAY: SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian hopes that a mass
opposition rally planned for Saturday will be held in a rational and
peaceful way, a spokesman for the Presidential Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
James Huang said that the president had said that people should
regard "with love and tolerance" the protests by the "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First Party.
</P>
<P>
The president understands the emotional response of the
"pan-blue alliance" supporters, Huang said, but hopes that they can
appeal their cause in a "rational and peaceful" way.
</P>
<P>
Huang claimed that the president's hope is like that of everyone
in Taiwan, which is that the turmoil in the wake of the election will
end as soon as possible and that society can return to normal.
</P>
<P>
Huang was responding to a "pan-blue alliance" plan to stage a
500,000-strong rally in front of the Presidential Office Saturday to
protest against what they perceive as an "unfair election" that saw
President Chen Shui-bian win another four-year term by a hair-thin
margin of 0.22 percent, or fewer than 30,000 votes, against his KMT
rival Lien Chan.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" have since
March 20 occupied the square in front of the Presidential Office,
demanding a recount of the ballots and an independent investigation
of the election-eve shooting of the president and vice president,
which they believe gave Chen sympathy votes and victory in the
bitterly contested election.

MARCH CCI CONSPICUOUSLY DOWN DUE TO ELECTION DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's consumer confidence index (CCI)
for March stood at 79.52 points, a conspicuous drop of 4.18 points
from the February level, Chu Yun-peng, the head of the Research
Center for Taiwan Economic Development under the National Central
University reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chu said that the March figure, the lowest since last October,
was caused by the election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu and post-election political
uncertainties. The survey, which was started before the election, Chu
continued, would have been even lower if it had been conducted after
the election.
</P>
<P>
Out of the six categories surveyed, four declined, with the
timing for buying stocks in the coming six months moving down the
most in scale to 66.1 points, down by 23.4 points from the previous
month. More than half of those polled said the next six months will
not be a good time for stock trading.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the points scored for the other three categories --
household economic situations, the timing for purchasing durable
goods, and the domestic employment market in the coming six months --
all dropped, with the score for the domestic employment market
registering the lowest figure among all six categories.
</P>
<P>
However, the score for domestic business conditions in the coming
six months rose from a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Commodity prices in the coming six months also rose slightly by
0.5 point from February, signaling that public worry has not
deteriorated. Nevertheless, news of an oil price hike had not been
announced during the poll, Chu said, adding that the impact will be
reflected in next month's figures.

WATER RATES WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED UNTIL SEPTEMBER AT EARLIEST

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water rates will not be adjusted until
September at the earliest, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Sheng-hsien, director-general of the MOEA's Water Resources
Agency, said that the adjustment of water rates will have to first be
proposed by the Taiwan Water Supply Corp. and the Taipei Water Corp.
and then reviewed by a committee to formulate a reasonable price
rate through a fair and transparent mechanism.
</P>
<P>
According to an initial estimate, it will be September at the
earliest before the proposals and reviews can be completed.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the agency will avoid making too great an adjustment at
one time and that the increase rate for basic water consumption will
be cut to the minimum so that most users will not feel the impact.
</P>
<P>
Chen also said that because the operational basis between the
Taiwan Water Supply Corp. and the Taipei Water Corp. will be
different, the water rates for Taipei City will still be lower than
those of Taiwan province in the future.

RICE PRICES IN TAIWAN STABLE: COA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The price of rice in the domestic market
has remained stable, with no sign of impending hikes, a spokesman for
the Food and Agricultural Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent effort to dismiss a report by local media, the
spokesman said that rice prices have not increased and pointed out
that current prices are at a similar level to the average price
recorded for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the COA will do its best to maintain stable rice
prices, the spokesman added that it will also consider releasing
stock held by government authorities across the country. He called on
the public not to worry about rice supplies and gave his assurances
that a large amount of the rice harvested in spring will be marketed
in May.
</P>
<P>
Local media have reported that the price of many staple
commodities, such as rice, maize, cooking oil, petroleum and gas, has
risen noticeably in recent months. It was reported that rice prices
have surged by 10 percent since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs announced that it will allow interim imports of
soybean powder and maize from mainland China from now until May 24 to
help the domestic livestock and farm industries overcome operational
difficulties in the face of mounting prices of imported animal feed
upon which they rely heavily.
</P>
<P>
According to a BOFT official, prices of imported animal feed in
the form of maize and soybean powder has increased by 20 percent
since late January, when a similar two-month long interim measure
ended. The BOFT decided to permit the short-term opening in response
to strong domestic demand, he noted.

U.S. HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER CONGRATULATES CHEN ON RE-ELECTION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay
(R-Texas) congratulated President Chen Shui-bian on his re-election
Friday, the Presidential Office said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the press statement, DeLay, speaking by telephone,
first expressed concerns for the injury Chen sustained in a failed
election-eve assassination attempt. DeLay said he would pray for
Chen's quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
Chen was slightly wounded when an unidentified assailant fired at
least two shots at the president and Vice President Annette Lu while
they were driving past large crowds of supporters in an open-top jeep
in the southern city of Tainan last Friday. The shooting grazed
Chen's abdomen and Lu's right knee.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Office press statement said DeLay also offered
his congratulations on Chen's re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
DeLay was quoted as having told Chen that his success in Taiwan's
most closely fought presidential election will receive full U.S.
recognition and support.
</P>
<P>
The influential U.S. congressman further said that Taiwan's
democratization and Chen's devotion to that bumpy process are
encouraging for American people and should be an inspiration to
mainland China and many other developing countries. DeLay assured
Chen that he and his congressional colleagues will offer full support
to Taiwan's cause.
</P>
<P>
DeLay said he hopes to organize a congressional delegation to
attend Chen's May 20 inauguration and he further said the U.S.
Congress will hold a series of activities in April to mark the 25th
anniversary of the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act -- the U.S.
law that regulates relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
DeLay also said the U.S. House of Representatives will pass a
resolution in April to push the Bush administration to offer more
assistance to Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization
(WHO) . DeLay said he and his colleagues will also make sure the
international community understands that the United States supports
Taiwan's WHO bid.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chen said Taiwan's accession to the WHO is not only
critical to the health and well-being of the 23 million Taiwan people
but will also symbolize an important step forward in relations across
the Taiwan Strait. Mainland China's opposition has been the biggest
obstacle to Taiwan's participation in the WHO and other major
international bodies.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Taiwan's post-election controversy, Chen told DeLay
that he has made a goodwill response to the demands of the rival
electoral team of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong for a vote recount.
</P>
<P>
"I support a quick, transparent and full-scale recount because I
never rigged the vote. In fact, the idea of vote-rigging never
occurred to me. Taiwan has come a long way to achieve democracy.
Vote-rigging is unlikely to work in our present electoral system, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The president also dismissed opposition allegations that he
staged the election-eve shooting to win sympathy votes. Chen said he
is more eager than anyone else to get to the bottom of the matter and
that he supports an independent inquiry into the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Although the Lien-Soong team has provided little specific
evidence of wrongdoing in last Saturday's election, large crowds of
his supporters have rallied in front of the Presidential Office
for the past six days, at first demanding a recount and more
recently calling for an entirely new election.

PRESIDENT MEETS ACADEMIA SINICA HEAD TO DISCUSS PEACE FRAMEWORK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian met with Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh Friday for a discussion on the
formation of an ad hoc group to push for the establishment of a
framework for peace and stability in cross-Taiwan Strait interaction.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Lee talked for about 90 minutes, mainly on the direction
of the soon-to-be-established ad hoc group and who will be appointed
as its members, according to Presidential Office spokesman Huang
Chih-fang.
</P>
<P>
Chen also appointed Lee as one of the two conveners of the
important ad hoc group, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The president is expected to announce a line-up of the group as
soon as a second person has been appointed as the other convener,
Huang added.
</P>
<P>
Koo Cheng-fu, chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), who Chen has envisaged as the second convener, did
not take part in Friday's meeting for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The head of the foundation established more than a decade ago to
handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal contact
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Ku, 87, has seldom made
public appearances in the recent year as a result of his advanced
age.
</P>
<P>
In his first news conference with members of the media from home
and abroad this year, Chen made clear Feb. 3 why he was promoting
what he referred to as the "peace referendum" that was held on the
March 20 presidential election day.
</P>
<P>
He called for a cross-strait agreement to serve as the basis for
future cooperation and the maintenance of peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"Signing a cross-strait 'peace and stability' agreement will not
only cultivate and further enhance mutual trust and minimize
misjudgments, but will also help the two sides to face and understand
the basic elements and rules for peaceful coexistence, " Chen said at
that time.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides of the strait are now at a crucial juncture in terms
of their respective development. Taiwan is in the process of major
domestic reforms, while mainland China is focused on its economic
development. If we are able to seize the momentum, it will have great
impact on our development and future prospects. The key lies in
whether both sides can create a stable environment conducive for each
side to devote itself to its own development," he added.
</P>
<P>
On avoiding military conflict, the president also called for the
establishment of demilitarized zones, including the removal of combat
personnel, equipment and deployed missiles, to create a "buffer zone
in terms of time and space." He also appealed for a prohibition on
the use of military and economic blockades.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Chen said, the two sides have been dispatching
appointed representatives to engage in negotiations. However, he
added, the negotiation process has been stalled by the mainland's
insistence on Taiwan's acceptance of Beijing's "one China" principle
and has used this to unilaterally obstruct negotiation channels,
thereby putting pressure on Taiwan to "give in."
</P>
<P>
"Through more than a decade of cross-strait exchanges, experience
shows that without direct contact and with the mainland's continued
refusal to negotiate, it is impossible to meet the requirements of
today's intensive exchanges," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the March 20 referendum, Taiwan voters were asked to vote on
two questions.
</P>
<P>
However, only 45.17 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots
in the first question in the referendum -- whether the country should
strengthen its anti-missile defense capability -- while 45.12 percent
voted on the second question -- whether the country should negotiate
a peace framework with the mainland China. Both failed to reach the
threshold of 50 percent required to be considered valid.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Taiwan will nevertheless carry out the questions
in a positive way regardless of the outcome of the referendum.

TAIWAN RAILWAY MULLS SHORT-DISTANCE TICKET FARE HIKE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) is
considering whether to raise ticket fares for short-distance
passengers as part of its plans to help increase revenues.
</P>
<P>
The TRA, which faces losses of up to NT$10 billion (US$303.03
million) every year, is also considering the feasibility of adopting
flexible ticket rates for long-distance passengers.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan Railway Administrator Hsu Ta-wen said that the present
ticket pricing structure is unreasonable, pointing out that around
200,000 passengers travel between Panchiao in Taipei County and
Sungshan in Taipei City each day for a flat fare of just NT$18,
irrespective of the class of train.
</P>
<P>
Hsu said that a "reasonable" price between Panchiao and Sungshan
on the "Tzuchiang" express train class should be NT$36.
</P>
<P>
In terms of operational costs, ticket fares for short hops should
be relatively the most expensive, Hsu added.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will solicit the support of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications to adjust the short-distance fare
according to the distance traveled, or else directly hike prices
across the board.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in view of the fact that the 345-km high-speed rail
link between Taipei and Kaohsiung will be inaugurated in October
2005, the TRA is considering ticket prices for passengers traveling
more than 200 kilometers between Monday and Thursday, in the hope
that cheaper prices will lure more passengers.
</P>
<P>
The TRA has estimated that both the volume of passenger and cargo
transportation will decrease this year.
</P>
<P>
The revenue from passenger transportation will be down by
NT$16.29 billion, down 12.38 percent from the previous year, mainly
because of the suspension of trains due to the construction of the
Nankang section of the high speed railway, it said.
</P>
<P>
The revenue from cargo transportation will also be down by about
NT$1.1 billion, a drop of around 10.72 percent in comparison to the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The TRA has estimated that it will face overall losses of NT$10.7
billion this year.

CEC TO FORMALLY ANNOUNCE 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WINNER
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Central Election Commission (CEC) is
expected to formally announce the winner of the March 2004
presidential election later Friday after it convenes a members
meeting to finish reviewing the election's procedures and related
affairs, according to CEC officials.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
won re-election by beating the opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket
of Kuomintang Chairman Lien and People First Party Chairman James
Soong by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes, or 0.2 percent of all
ballots counted.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the President and Vice President Election and
Recall Law, the CEC should make a formal publication of the winner
seven days after a presidential election, CEC Chairman Huang
Shih-cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the CEC is expected to make the formal announcement
later in the day, despite the fact that Lien and Soong have disputed
the election results and have demanded a vote recount.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the Lien-Soong ticket said a day earlier that the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" might file another lawsuit with the
Taiwan High Court seeking an annulment of the March 20 election after
the Central Election Commission (CEC) formally announces the election
winner.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan High Court on Thursday rejected an earlier lawsuit
filed by Lien Chan seeking to invalidate the election in the wake of
the announcement of Saturday's election results.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "pan-blue alliance" legislators have been seeking an
amendment to the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law
stipulating that the CEC not formally publish a declaration of the
winner of a controversial election.
</P>
<P>
If the amendment clears the Legislature, the High Court will have
no legal basis to reject the annulment lawsuit again, and against
this backdrop, the "pan-blue alliance" will file an interlocutory
appeal to the court, lawyer Huang Shan-shan said.
</P>
<P>
She said that if the amendment fails to be passed by the
Legislature, the CEC will announce the presidential election winner
as scheduled, adding that the "pan-blue alliance" will file another
lawsuit after such an announcement is made.

A U.S. State Department official said
Thursday that he expects the Bush administration will congratulate
Taiwan's president-elect and vice president-elect after the island's
Central Election Commission officially declares on Friday the winner
of the March 20 election.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
defeated the opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong by a
razor-thin margin of less than 30,000 votes. Lien and Soong have
disputed the election result.
</P>
<P>
Lu expressed Thursday her hope that U.S. President George W. Bush
will send a message of congratulations to Chen and herself after the
CEC's declaration Friday. She also asked the U.S. government to send
a high-level delegation to participate in the May 20 inauguration
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
While responding to Lu's comments, the unnamed State Department
official only said he expects that the Bush administration will
express its congratulations to Chen and Lu after the CEC's
declaration.
</P>
<P>
However, the official did not make any comments on Lu's request
that the Bush administration send a high-level delegation to attend
the inauguration ceremony, saying only that any delegation the U.S.
government sends to Taiwan will be in line with the unofficial nature
of relations between the two countries.

TAIWAN TAKES RIGHT PATH TO AVOID IRRELEVANCE IN DOHA TALKS: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Geneva,  March 25 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and P.C. Tang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan could have become an isolated and
"irrelevant" member "without a voice" in the Doha Round agricultural
talks if it had not moved in the right direction, Taiwan's top trade
official in Geneva said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yen Ching-chang, Taiwan's permanent representative to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), made the comments while analyzing Taiwan's
performance in the multilateral agricultural negotiations of the Doha
Round Trade Talks which resumed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan is a small country, its decision last year to
join the G-10 Group has strengthened its position and made it
impossible for other WTO members to ignore the island in the
agricultural talks, Yen said.
</P>
<P>
The G-10 Group, made up of Taiwan, Bulgaria, Israel, Iceland,
Japan, Mauritius, Norway, Switzerland, South Korea and Liechtenstein,
is aimed at protecting and advancing the agricultural interests of
its members.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the efforts made by Taiwan's relevant
government agencies and its permanent mission to the WTO have helped
the island explain effectively its positions in the agricultural
talks, Yen said that Taiwan, as a key member of the G-10 Group, had
contact in the talks with leading agricultural countries and
organizations, including the United States, the European Union,
Canada and New Zealand, as well as members of the "Special Products
Union" and other agricultural product exporting nations.
</P>
<P>
According to Yen, Taiwan and other members of the G-10 Group have
also sought cooperation with the members of the "Special Products
Union" in the hopes of being able to get the maximum protection for
their special products.
</P>
<P>
He also said that in the so-called three pillars of the agricultural
talks, the tariff quota system and tariff cuts aimed at market opening,
are the issues that Taiwan is most concerned about.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural talks which began Tuesday are the first of their
kind to be held since the setback at the Fifth WTO Ministerial
Conference held in Cancun, Mexico last September. That conference
failed mainly because of the differences among WTO members over
issues regarding agricultural talks.

PRESIDENT VOWS TO BOOST RELATIONS WITH U.S., JAPAN IN COMING TERM

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian vowed Saturday to
step up Taiwan's friendly relations with the United States and Japan
based upon the existing foundations during his coming four-year term,
according to a presidential aide.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-fang, director of the Department of Public Affairs
under the Presidential Office, made the remarks after the two
countries sent their separate congratulations to President Chen on
his re-election.
</P>
<P>
The president was quoted by Huang as saying that his
administration will also closely cooperate with the United States and
Japan to help boost stability, security and prosperity in the
Asia-Pacific area.
</P>
<P>
The White House congratulated Chen on his being re-elected after
the Central Election Commission officially proclaimed his victory in
the March 20 election Friday, but said in its statement that there
are pending legal challenges to the result of the election.
</P>
<P>
On President Chen's behalf, Huang extended his heartfelt
gratitude to the U.S. and Japan for their congratulatory messages,
and he said the Presidential Office approves of the White House's
remarks that all election-related disputes should be resolved through
Taiwan's existing legal mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
"We applaud the people of Taiwan for embracing established legal
mechanisms and rejecting extra-legal options to resolve their
differences," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Chen and his running mate -- Vice President Annette Lu -- beat
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" ticket of Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong by a razor-thin
margin of just under 30,000 votes, or 0.228 percent.
</P>
<P>
After refusing to accept the election results, the "pan-blue
alliance" filed a lawsuit to seek the election's annulment and
demanded that a judicial recount of all ballots be conducted
immediately. That lawsuit was thrown out because it was incorrectly
filed.

<P>
The White House congratulated Republic
of China President Chen Shui-bian on his being re-elected after
Taiwan's Central Election Commission officially proclaimed his
victory in the March 20 election Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Press Secretary at the White House
noted that there are pending legal challenges to the results of the
election. "We applaud the people of Taiwan for embracing established
legal mechanisms and rejecting extra-legal options to resolve their
differences," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The White House also reiterated its commitment to Taiwan as
provided in the Taiwan Relations Act, urging the country, as well as
Beijing, to pursue dialogue and refrain from unilateral steps that
would alter Taiwan's status.
</P>
<P>
As regard its own part, the White House promised to continue to
maintain close unofficial ties with the people on Taiwan in
accordance with its "one-China" policy, as embodied in the Taiwan
Relations Act and the three Joint Communiques between the United
States and the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Following is the full text of the statement:
</P>
<P>
"We join the American people in congratulating the people of
Taiwan on the successful conclusion of their March 20 presidential
election. Taiwan's Central Election Commission on March 26 officially
proclaimed that Mr. Chen Shui-bian has won re-election, and we
congratulate Mr. Chen on his victory.
</P>
<P>
" We recognize that there are pending legal challenges to the
results of the March 20 election. We applaud the people of Taiwan for
embracing established legal mechanisms and rejecting extra-legal
options to resolve their differences. We reject calls for violence,
which threaten the very democratic principles to which we and the
people of Taiwan are committed.
</P>
<P>
"The maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and
the welfare of the people of Taiwan remain of profound importance to
the United States. To advance these goals, the United States will
fulfill its obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act. It falls to
Taiwan and Beijing to build the essential foundations for peace and
stability by pursuing dialogue through all available means and
refraining from unilateral steps that would alter Taiwan's status.
</P>
<P>
We will continue to maintain close unofficial ties with the
people on Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan in
accordance with our "one-China" policy, as embodied in the Taiwan
Relations Act and our three Joint Communiques with the People's
Republic of China.

DPP CALLS FOR SETTLEMENT OF ELECTION DISPUTES BY JUDICIAL MEANS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) reiterated its appeal Saturday to settle disputes regarding the
March 20 presidential election through judicial channels.
</P>
<P>
DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung made the appeal when he
commented on a mass protest staged by supporters of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" formed by the Kuomintang (KMT) , People First
Party (PFP) and New Party in front of the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that President Chen Shui-bian has agreed to revise the
President and Vice President Election and Recall Law to pave the way
for a vote recount and to accept experts recommended by the "pan-blue
alliance" to join the investigation into the shooting of President
Chen and Vice President Annette Lu on the eve of the election. Chang
said the moves were made out of goodwill by the president.
</P>
<P>
If the opposition camp or both KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong themselves obtain any evidence of electoral
fraud or crimes, they should deliver them to the court, Chang said,
claiming that both President Chen and the ruling party are willing to
cooperate with the judicial authorities to investigate the alleged
cases and to accept the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
The DPP does not want to see the opposition camp resorting to
unlawful moves or violence in its protests, which would jeopardize
the harmony and social order of the country, Chang noted, suggesting
that Lien and Soong should allow the demonstrations to end
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Both Chang and Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, DPP legislative caucus
whip, called on their party members and supporters to avoid the
vicinities of the demonstration site and refrain from provoking the
rival camp.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" supporters have staged the demonstration
since last Saturday shortly after the Central Election Commission
announced preliminary results of the election which gave President
Chen another four-year term by defeating Lien by a slim margin of
0.228 percent, or fewer than 30,000 votes out of the approximately 13
million ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
The "pan blue alliance" supporters described the election as
"unfair" and asked for a recount of the votes and demanded that an
independent investigation panel be established to look into the March
19 shooting which they believed gave Chen sympathy votes and victory
in the hotly contested race.

PAN-BLUE PROTEST DRAWS LARGE CROWD IN TAIPEI
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 320,000 people braved chilling
drizzle to gather in Taipei and protest what rally organizers claimed
was "unfairness" in the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,600 tour buses loaded with participants of the
protest began to converge on the capital from around the island
Saturday noon, and still more people from metropolitan Taipei joined
the protest organized by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
A group of protesters, led by Penghu County Magistrate Lai
Feng-wei flew in from the outlying island county Saturday morning to
take part in the event.
</P>
<P>
The protestors, gathered at the square in front of the
Presidential Office, echoed the organizers' call, demanding the
administration of President Chen Shui-bian to clear away any doubts
surrounding the presidential election in which the joint KMT-PFP
ticket lost by a slim margin of 0.228 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of the March 20 presidential election, Lien and
Soong led a group of their supporters to stage an overnight protest
in front of the Presidential Office, saying that the election was
"unfair." The protest had gone on for a week when the two parties
called in more supporters to stage what organizers said would be a
"huge protest unseen in the capital before."
</P>
<P>
Many KMT and PFP lawmakers took turns giving speeches during the
protest, urging Chen's administration to grant their requests for a
recount of the votes and an independent investigation into a shooting
incident the day before the election in which Chen and Vice President
Annette Lu were injured. The shooting sparked speculation that the
incident was the main reason for their victory and many wondered why
the government put the armed forces and police on a higher alert
after the incident, thereby stripping them of their right to vote.
Many in the armed forces are KMT and PFP supporters.
</P>
<P>
They also disputed criticism from the ruling party that most of
the protesters were mainlanders and their descendants, arguing that
the make-up of the crowd included people of different ethnic groups
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
These politicians also took issue with assumptions that the
protesters came to the gathering carrying weapons, such as Molotov
cocktails, looking for a chance to resort to violence. Rather, they
said, the protesters are law-abiding people.
</P>
<P>
The protest put Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who was a leading
campaigner for Lien and Soong, in a tight spot. As a rising political
star in the KMT-PFP alliance, he should stand shoulder to shoulder
with Lien and Soong in the protest to reinforce his status as their
successor, but as chief of City Hall, Ma is obliged to keep peace and
order around the city, not least of all around the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
Ma has also been pressed by his ruling party critics to get tough
with the protestors.
</P>
<P>
Ma chose to do a delicate balancing act between the two forces.
Although he gave a pep talk to the protesters Saturday afternoon, he
did not appear together with Lien and Soong in the protest and was
careful not to offend the protesters by breaking up the gathering by
force. Instead, the soft-spoken mayor gently dissuaded the protesters
from violently venting their frustration with the re-election of
President Chen.
</P>
<P>
Since the time for the protest to end was 6 p.m, Ma said he had
approved another protest site applied for by the KMT at the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall from March 28 until April 3. He said he hoped
that the protestors would move to the memorial hall, which is a
little further from the Presidential Office. He said that their
presence there would be less disturbing to the residents of the city.
</P>
<P>
On a different note, politics makes strange bedfellows, as was
shown by the curious assortment of visitors to the protest, including
former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang, who staged a 66-hour hunger
strike to show his solidarity with the protesters, and independent
lawmaker Sisy Chen, who is a former DPP leader and an outspoken
critic of President Chen. As usual, Sisy Chen made a scathing
criticism of the president to the great pleasure of her audience.
</P>
<P>
Although the protest was peaceful in general, Taipei City
authorities summoned 4,600 police to maintain peace around the area,
with another 4,000 ready to join them if necessary, and another 3,000
in reserve.
</P>
<P>
After the 6 p.m. deadline, people were seen slowly leaving the
protest site, although it was not immediately clear if any of them
would remain beyond the deadline to end the protest at the
Presidential Office.

TRAFFIC SITUATION IN TAIPEI GOOD DESPITE MASS RALLY

Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)

<P>
The traffic situation in Taipei remained
good on Saturday despite the fact that a mass demonstration by the
opposition camp was held in the afternoon in front of the
Presidential Office, according to the city's traffic authorities.
</P>
<P>
Municipal traffic police officers said that the overall traffic
situation in the city was largely good, except for some areas
adjacent to the Presidential Office.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the number of the demonstrators, who
gathered around in the Presidential Office to protest what they
claimed was an "unfair and rigged" March 20 presidential election,
was about 320,000.
</P>
<P>
The opposition "pan-blue alliance" estimated a day earlier that
more than 3,000 tour buses carrying supporters from around the
country would flock to Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan of the
"pan-blue alliance" formed by the KMT, the People First Party and the
New Party, lost the presidential election to incumbent President Chen
Shui-bian, who won a second term in office by a very small margin of
fewer than 30,000 ballots -- or 0.228 percent of the more than 13
million votes cast.

Along with the continuous political
upheaval following the presidential election, Shih Chung-tang,
president of ASUSTeK, the world-renowned computer manufacturer based

cross-Taiwan Strait links -- trade, transportation and postal
services.
</P>
<P>
Shih, at an interview after the closing of the company's first

both the "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green camp" should calm
down and settle the political issues in peace together to stabilize
the political and economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The direct cross-strait "three links" should be the economic core
after the presidential election, he continued, adding that President
Chen Shui-bian should treat mainland China-Taiwan issues using
perspective, and take global competition into consideration while
working on mainland China-related strategies. Taiwan would lose an
opportunity of upgrading its competitive edges in the long term if
proper strategies are not put in place, Shih said.

PUBLIC URGED TO BE CALM IN FACE OF MARCH 27 MASS DEMONSTRATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven local government chiefs of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in southern Taiwan issued a
joint declaration Saturday urging the public in the southern area to
remain calm and tolerant in the face of the March 27 mass
demonstration launched by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was jointly released by magistrates and mayors of
Chiayi County, Chiayi City, Tainan County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung
City, Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County at a news conference in
the southern port city.
</P>
<P>
In their declaration, the DPP magistrates and mayors said that
the public in southern Taiwan will closely cooperate with the
government to help stabilize the country and that everybody should be
perfectly calm and respect each other.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they also exhorted supporters of the "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to
accept the March 20 election results. KMT Chairman Lien Chan and his
running mate -- PFP Chairman James Soong -- lost the election to
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu by a very slim
margin of 0.228 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said at the news conference that the
seven DPP local government chiefs got together for the first time
after the election to pool their wisdom to cope with various
post-election disputes. "We hope that southern Taiwan will play a
pivotal role in stabilizing the island," he went on.
</P>
<P>
As the difference of the number of votes garnered by the two
presidential tickets was very small, Hsieh pointed out, it is
reasonable for the loser to file a lawsuit and demand a recount of
all ballots cast in the election.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the "pan-blue alliance" should not
change their appeals again and again, adding that all
election-related disputes must be resolved through existing judicial
procedures.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" flocked
to the Presidential Office from across the country Saturday to
protest against what they describe as an "unfair" election. They
joined thousands of supporters who have been in the square in front
of the Presidential Office conducting a marathon sit-in since late
Saturday after the election ended.

THIRTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF EMPLOYEES WORKING TOO MANY HOURS PER WEEK
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 37 percent of workers in Taiwan
work more hours per week than allowed by the Labor Standards Act,
according to a survey by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).
</P>
<P>
The Labor Standards Act stipulates that workers must not exceed
84 hours of work every two weeks, but the CLA found that only about
67 percent of workers do not work over 42 hours each week.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 9,606 replies from Taiwan businesses found that 39
percent of laborers work a 40-hour week. Seventeen percent work 42
hours, 13 percent work 44 hours, and 12 percent work 48 hours each
week.
</P>
<P>
Around 90 percent of businesses regulate the daily working hours
of their employees. Among them, 77 percent demand an eight-hour
workday. On average, 8.1 hours a day was stipulated.
</P>
<P>
Around 13 percent of businesses asked their employees to do
overtime. The finance and insurance sectors had the highest overtime
rate at 60 percent. Less than 20 percent of other businesses demanded
that their employees do overtime.
</P>
<P>
However, the results of the survey showed that 49 percent of
state-run enterprises needed overtime work, 13 percent higher than
private enterprises. The bigger the private enterprises, the higher
the percentage. Seventy-one percent of the private enterprises with
500 or more workers asked for overtime.
</P>
<P>
In the CLA poll, more than 50 percent of workers enjoy two days
off each week, and around 20 percent work on Saturdays conditionally,
with 15 percent working six days a week.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight percent of businesses operate five days a week, an
increase of 1.1 percent from 2002. The percentage of companies that
have six-day working weeks is declining and now stands at about 28
percent, the survey showed.

GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS DEMONSTRATION WITH LENIENCY: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
that his administration will deal with the ongoing mass demonstration
in front of the Presidential Office under the principles of
"listening, understanding, law and union."
</P>
<P>
Noting that he has ever engaged with the opposition movement,
President Chen said that he can understand demonstration
participants' feelings, so his administration will treat, with love,
leniency and tolerance, the post-election protest staged by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who won re-election, voiced the hope that all participants
in the demonstration will express their appeals in a rational way and
that the protest activity will end peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan has endured a great deal of hardships on its way to
democracy, so the country's hard-gained democratic achievements
should be cherished and protected meticulously by all citizens, " the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he is president of all the people of Taiwan, Chen
vowed to do whatever he can to unite the nation and all the people of
Taiwan, which he said is his top duty and obligation.
</P>
<P>
As for the "pan-blue alliance's" demand for a recount of the
election ballots, Chen said that the president-elect and vice
president-elect were formally announced by the Central Election
Commission, so a judicial recount is expected to start soon.
</P>
<P>
If the "pan-blue alliance" thinks a judicial recount comes too
late to be of use in a crisis, the president pointed out, they can
resort to negotiations between the ruling and oppositions parties to
sort out this problem in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen stressed that to start an across-the-board vote
recount immediately, the opposition camp should refrain from bringing
forward any additional conditions to boycott future negotiations in
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the alliance's suspicions that the March 19 gun
attack on Chen and his running mate -- Vice President Annette Lu --
was staged to win voters' support for the Chen-Lu ticket, the
president said he supports State Public Prosecutor-General Lu
Ren-fa's proposal that Dr. Henry Lee, a world-renowned
Chinese-American forensic expert, be invited to join an independent
forensic panel to get to the bottom of the shooting to put an end to
the election controversy as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
With respect to the rival camp's claim that the activation of the
national security mechanism following the shooting barred many
soldiers and police officers from casting their ballots in the March
20 election, Chen explained that only one-ninth of the soldiers were
required to stay in their barracks because of the national security
mechanism activation, and he added that the measure was not improper.

POLITICAL INSTABILITY MAY FUEL CAPITAL FLIGHT: BANKING INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's political instability in the wake
of the March 20 presidential election may fuel capital flight out of
the country if the present situation cannot be resolved in the short
term, sources from the banking industry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Should the current turmoil over the election's result not be
settled quickly and peacefully, a larger amount of domestic and
foreign capital will be remitted out of Taiwan, the sources warned.
</P>
<P>
A historic second-largest transaction level of US$2.99 billion
was registered on March 22 -- the first trading day after the
presidential election -- in the Taipei foreign exchange market as a
result of heavy selling pressure of the new Taiwan dollar in exchange
for the U. S. dollar, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Although the central bank intervened by selling U. S. dollars to
prevent a fall of the local currency that day, the new Taiwan dollar
still depreciated by NT$0.032 to finish at NT$33.285 against the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the surge in transaction level to robust
demand for U. S. dollars, including that from import businesses and
foreign exchange departments of banks and individual customers. There
are no signs currently of large outflows of foreign capital from
Taiwan, they added.
</P>
<P>
A bank executive in charge of foreign exchange operations said
that selling pressure of the local currency during this period has
been stronger compared to the same period following the presidential
election four years ago, when Taiwan's first transfer of power was
crystallized.
</P>
<P>
The current atmosphere is similar to that of 1995 when mainland
China fired test missiles to the waters near Taiwan, evident in that
the public demand for the U. S. dollar has markedly increased amid
political uncertainties, the bank executive observed.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his concern that foreign capital that has
remained in the domestic market is very likely to leave Taiwan if the
country's democratic image and law and order are eroded. Should the
political situation stabilize, the market is expected to return to
normal quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" supporters
have been demonstrating a marathon protest in the square in front of
the Presidential Office in Taipei over the result of the March 20
presidential poll since late that day.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" candidate -- prime opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan -- lost the race to incumbent President Chen
Shui-bian by a very slim margin of 0.228 percent, or fewer than
30,000 ballots out of more than 1.3 million votes cast.

LAW ENFORCERS ASKED TO GATHER EVIDENCE IF PROTEST TURNS VIOLENT
</HEADLINE>

Taipei, March 27 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Law enforcers in Taipei have been asked to
keep watch for any violence during Saturday's protest demonstration
in the capital called by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP), according a spokesman for the Executive Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chia-lung, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, quoted Premier
Yu Shyi-kun as saying Saturday morning that law enforcers should
gather evidence of any violence in the protest and bring those
responsible to justice afterward.
</P>
<P>
Yu also asked prosecutors to look into the clash between
protestors and police at the Central Election Commission (CEC)
offices on Friday, when supporters of the KMT and PFP tried to storm
the CEC to prevent it from declaring President Chen Shui-bian as the
winner of the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some KMT and PFP lawmakers took part in the brawl
with police, the premier has asked law enforcers to call these
opposition lawmakers to account.
</P>
<P>
The premier, who said the previous day that his administration
has contingency plans to deal with 15 different scenarios at the
protest, also ordered the establishment of a panel to keep government
agencies as well as foreign journalists in the country informed of
the latest developments regarding the protest.
</P>
<P>
In a response to Beijing's warning on Friday that it won't sit on
its hands in case rioting erupts in Taiwan, the premier said the
government will spare no effort in preventing the protest from
developing into a riot and denying Beijing any excuse to interfere.

from the Presidential Office to arrange a meeting between President
Chen Shui-bian and the chairmen of the two opposition parties, a KMT

KMT spokesman Tsai Cheng-yuan made the remarks after the

Chen told a news conference Saturday evening that he is willing
to meet with the defeated presidential electoral team of Lien
and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong Monday without any
strings attached.
</P>
<P>
Ting said Lien and Soong had hoped to meet Chen since the
March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"President Chen first didn't make any response. And now he
abruptly agrees to meet with Lien and Soong unconditionally. It
requires further discussions to set the stage for the proposed
meeting," Ting said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ting, President Chen's chief of staff Chiou I-jen
should talk with KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng and PFP
Secretary-General Tsai Chung-hsiung to work out technical details for
the Chen-Lien-Soong meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Presidential Office source said earlier in the day that Chiou
already telephoned KMT and PFP secretaries-general for arranging the
proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for a response from the Lien-Soong camp so that
we can determine the exact time, venue and agenda for the planned
meeting," said one of Chiou's close aides.
</P>
<P>
The Lien-Soong ticket has contested the outcome of the March 20
election, in which Chen defeated Lien by a slim margin of 0.228
percent or 29,518 ballots out of more than 13 million cast. Lien and
Soong have mobilized their supporters to demonstrate non-stop at the
Presidential Office square for the past week.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, about half a million of the Lien-Soong
supporters thronged the streets surrounding the Presidential Office,
demanding a "judicial" vote recount and an independent inquiry into a
failed election-eve assassination attempt against Chen that the
opposition camp claimed had unfairly swayed sympathy votes Chen's
way.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, Chen responded to the Lien-Soong camp requests at an
evening news conference, saying that as long as the "pan-blue
alliance" presidential contenders filed either an annulment or a
recount lawsuit, he would sign a letter of consent to allow for an
immediate and complete ballot recount regardless of whether evidence
of election fraud is provided.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of the recount, and it is my commitment to fully
accept the results of the recount whether or not they are in my
favor. I hope that KMT Chairman Lien and PFP Chairman Soong will be
able to do the same," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also retracted a previous request that Lien and Soong disperse
the demonstrators at Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential
Office before meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to meet with the two pan-blue alliance leaders on Monday
unconditionally," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He further said he will order law enforcement officers to clear
up Ketagalan Boulevard by Monday.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" rally at Ketagalan Boulevard ended at 6
p.m. Saturday, but some demonstrators refused to leave the site.
Outnumbered by police, some protesters left reluctantly but
calmly Sunday morning, while others struggled briefly. Some joined
another sit-in at the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall complex nearby.
</P>
<P>
The end of the week-long demonstration outside the Presidential
Office is a relief for many Taiwan residents.
</P>
<P>
During Saturday's news conference, President Chen also refuted
opposition allegations that he staged the election-eve shooting
incident to boost his re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
Chen's voice quivered with rage when he described his humiliation
at suspicions that he staged the mysterious shooting.
</P>
<P>
"I have never staged this shooting incident and there is nothing
to hide. The investigation will be fair and transparent," Chen said.
"I do not want to bear this bad name any longer."
</P>
<P>
Chen vowed to step down at once if his rival could prove the
failed assassination in which a bullet gashed his abdomen had been
staged and challenged Lien to find the world's best sniper to
re-enact the shooting.
</P>
<P>
"If you can't do it or you are afraid of doing it, then shut up,"
he told Lien and Soong.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were both slightly wounded by
two bullets from a homemade gun as they campaigned in the southern
city of Tainan on the March 19 afternoon.

TIME NOT YET RIPE TO DISCUSS PAN-BLUE MERGER: KMT SPOKESMAN
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time is not yet ripe for the three
political parties of the "pan-blue alliance" to merge, a spokesman of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Alex Tsai was responding to questions about whether the KMT and
its splinter parties, namely the New Party and the People First Party
(PFP), will merge following KMT Chairman Lien Chan's remarks during a
mass rally the previous day that the three parties will cooperate
even more closely in the wake of the March 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Tsai said that "there has been consistent speculation to that
effect, but the timing is not yet ripe."
</P>
<P>
"The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has pulled out all
stops to try to disintegrate 'pan-blue alliance' cooperation, " Tsai
said, adding that he wanted to advise the DPP to direct its efforts
in the right places.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has
urged KMT Chairman Lien Chan to concede defeat and step down as the
party chairman.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Chen-lung, whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union at the
Legislative Yuan, said that Lien, at the age of 68, is too old, and
that the KMT under his leadership has undergone several major
setbacks.
</P>
<P>
"Lien should pass the baton to others and let the grand old party
become Taiwanized, " Cheng said, adding that Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng is the perfect candidate to take the helm of
the KMT.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said that the KMT should learn the will of the people to
move toward the direction of Taiwanization, adding that if Wang
serves as its chairman, the party can maintain its power to balance
that of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
He also said that PFP Chairman James Soong has charisma and is
unlikely to step down from the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
He said the KMT and the PFP will have to go their own ways in the
year-end legislative elections and that there is a possibility that
the PFP could replace the KMT as the second largest party in the
225-seat Legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lien teamed up with Soong in the March 20 presidential election,
but President Chen Shui-bian of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) won re-election by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes
out of a total of nearly 13 million valid ballots.
</P>
<P>
Lien has yet to concede defeat. He has raised questions about the
"fairness" of the election and demanded that there be an immediate
vote recount and that an ad hoc committee be established to
investigate the election-eve assassination attempt against President
Chen and Vice President Annette Lu which many believe decisively
influenced the outcome of the election by garnering sympathy votes
for Chen and Lu.

DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS DENIES TRYING TO LURE AWAY KMT LAWMAKERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) denied Sunday that it has stepped
up efforts to lure opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers to its camp
after President Chen Shui-bian's re-election.
</P>
<P>
Media reports quoted unidentified KMT legislators as saying that
the DPP legislative caucus is lobbying native Taiwanese KMT lawmakers
to join its ranks to facilitate passage of major bills proposed by
Chen's administration.
</P>
<P>
"The reports are not factual, " said DPP legislative whip Tsai
Huang-lang. "We have not taken such actions for the moment."
</P>
<P>
In his view, Tsai said, the best timing for the DPP to form a
"majority alliance" in the Legislative Yuan is after the legislative
elections scheduled for late this year.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Tsai said, the DPP will focus on forging
cooperative ties with opposition parties on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
He said that before the year-end legislative elections, the DPP
legislative caucus hopes to cooperate with its opposition
counterparts in completing legislation of a number of important bills
to boost economic, political and financial reforms, including the
political party bill, the Executive Yuan restructuring bill, the
Judicial Yuan organization bill, and amendments to the statute
governing the Financial Reconstruction Fund.
</P>
<P>
As to the formation of a "majority alliance" with opposition
lawmakers, Tsai said, such a sensitive topic will not be addressed
until after the new Legislature is elected late this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the DPP is the largest party in the current Legislature,
it doesn't hold more than half of the seats. As a result, many
critical bills are pending approval of the Legislature, which is
controlled by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nearly all influential native Taiwanese KMT
lawmakers ruled out the possibility of an intraparty split before the
year-end legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Lee Chuang-chiao from Tainan County in southern Taiwan
said he feels the KMT should revise its basic policy line to win more
support from local residents after the bitterly contested
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the election outcome shows that Taiwan's separate
national identity has won more recognition among voters, Lee said
the KMT must adapt its party platform to this mainstream trend.
</P>
<P>
In the just-concluded presidential election, KMT Chairman Lien
Chan teamed up with People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong to
challenge President Chen's re-election bid. Chen won with a slim
margin of 29,518 votes, or 0.228 percent out of 13 million ballots
cast. Lien refused to concede defeate and will file a lawsuit
to annul the election Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the KMT will address its party platform revision issue
after the election controversy is settled. As to whether the KMT will
merge with the PFP, he said, it's up to Lien and Soong to make
a decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Another KMT legislator, Lin Yi-shih, said incumbent native
Taiwanese KMT lawmakers are unlikely to "defect" to the DPP camp
before the year-end legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who is also a KMT Central Standing Committee member, said he
hope the KMT and the PFP will coordinate their nomination strategy
for the year-end legislative election in order to win as many seats
as possible.

DEATH RATE FOR TUBERCULOSIS DROPS 60-FOLD IN 5 DECADES: DOH
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death rate for tuberculosis dropped
60-fold in Taiwan over the past five decades thanks to the strenuous
efforts of the island's medical staff, a Department of Health (DOH)
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
DOH Deputy Minister Lee Lung-teng made the remarks at a meeting
in Taipei to mark world efforts in tuberculosis prevention.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the death rate in Taiwan used to be nearly 300 out
of every 100,000 persons five decades ago, but the ratio dropped to a
little more than 5 out of every 100,000 persons in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who has first-hand understanding of the disease because both
of his parents were tuberculosis patients, said that the formulation
and implementation of health policy requires wisdom from all sides
and adjustments with the passage of the time.
</P>
<P>
He cited the approach of the World Health Organization (WHO) in
ending the practice of concentrating tuberculosis patients in one
medical institution as an example.
</P>
<P>
Judging from his own experience, Lee said that it is not easy to
educate society on the importance of tuberculosis prevention and then
proceed to prevent the disease in a short time.
</P>
<P>
He said that based on the WHO standard of less than two deaths
out of every 100,000 persons, Taiwan still has a long way to go in
its fight against the disease.

Japanese runners Otaki Masayuki and Kimie
Noto won the men's and women's events of the 2004 Soochow University
International Ultramarathon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Braving rains and chilly weather, a score of runners from around
the world, including Edit Berces from Hungary, the women's world
record holder with a distance of 250.108 kilometers, competed in the
fifth Soochow University International Ultramarathon that began
Saturday on its campus in suburban Taipei.
</P>
<P>
This ultramarathon is a race to see who can run the farthest in
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese runners proved to be the best in this year's Taipei
race of endurance, with Masayuki winning the men's title with a
record distance of 271.75 kilometers, followed by his fellow
countryman Nobumi Iwamato with a distance of 247.26 kilometers, and
Kimie Noto garnering the women's title with a distance of 226.99
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Ryoichi Sekiya, who won the men's title last year, dropped out of
this year's race after 152 kilometers due to a pulled thigh muscle.
</P>
<P>
Edit Berces, who was last year's champion in the women's
category, failed to finish the 24-hour ultramarathon for unknown
reasons.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chin-tsai, the top runner from Taiwan, finished fourth in
the men's category with a distance of 220.03 kilometers, while Chang
Mei-lien finished sixth in the women's category with a distance of
190.06 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Masayuki, a physician and an amateur marathoner, said winning the
title was a surprise even to himself. He said his best hope had been
to finish second behind Sekiya, adding that after Sekiya dropped out
late Saturday night, he tried his utmost to "retain the championship
for Japan."
</P>
<P>
Masayuki said that he runs to work every morning to his hospital
office located 30 kilometers away from his home. He noted that he has
often promoted running to his patients as an effective way to improve
their health, adding however that he discourages his excessively
plump patients from running.

FIVE STATE-OWNED BANKS TO RECRUIT 446 NEW STAFF MEMBERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid a domestic economic recovery, five
state-owned banks will recruit a total of 446 clerks this year,
financial sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The five banks -- Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, Land
Bank of Taiwan, Central Trust of China, and the Export-Import Bank of
the Republic of China -- have commissioned the Taiwan Academy of
Banking and Finance (TABF) to handle a joint examination for
hopefuls, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"This marks the first time in nearly a decade that the five
state-owned banks have held such a large-scale employee recruitment
drive, "a TABF executive said.
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday, about 30,000 hopefuls had registered for the
examination. The registration deadline is April 2. Hopefuls must be
aged under 28 years and have at least a senior high school diploma to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
Among the five banks, Land Bank and Taiwan Cooperative Bank
will each recruit 150 new clerks; Bank of Taiwan will recruit 120
clerks; Central Trust of China will recruit 25 clerks; while the
Export-Import Bank will only recruit one.
</P>
<P>
Except for the Export-Import Bank, the four other banks will all
be privatized soon. Taiwan Cooperative Bank will complete its
privatization process by the end of this year, while Bank of
Taiwan, Land Bank of Taiwan and Central Trust of China will be
privatized by the end of 2006. In order to retain their status as
civil servants, many staff members of these four banks have
transferred to other government agencies, thus leaving a number of
job positions vacant, banking sources said.

MEETING COULD MARK FIRST STEP TOWARD RECONCILIATION: DPP LEGISLATOR

<P>
Monday's meeting between President Chen
Shui-bian and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" leaders could mark
the beginning of inter-party reconciliation in the wake of disputes
over the March 20 election outcome, a legislator from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tsai Huang-lang, DPP whip at the Legislative Yuan, said "the
president has shown his sincerity, " adding that he hopes the meeting
between Chen and Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
Chairman James Soong will mark the first step toward reconciliation
between the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Tsai's words followed the peaceful conclusion of a mass rally by
some 500,000 opposition "pan-blue alliance" supporters Saturday
afternoon and President Chen's evening press conference in which he
responded to their calls by saying that he would like to listen to
different views and that he is willing to meet with Lien and Soong
Monday without any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Tsai also said he hopes both Lien and Soong can display sincerity
and broadmindedness and contribute toward "drawing a vision for the
nation."
</P>
<P>
Tsai said the meeting should focus on such major issues as
cooperation between the ruling and the opposition parties and
cross-strait relations, instead of dwelling on disputes over the
election outcome.
</P>
<P>
President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu won the March 20
election by a razor-thin margin of just 29,518 votes, or 0.228
percent of the nearly 13 million valid ballots counted, over the
"pan-blue alliance" ticket of Lien and Soong.
</P>
<P>
"Pan-blue alliance" supporters have since been protesting against
what they perceived as an "unfair election" and demanding an
immediate vote recount and an independent investigation into the
assassination attempt against the president and vice president on the
eve of the election which many feel decisively influenced the
election outcome in terms of garnering sympathy votes for Chen and
Lu.

TAIWAN TO PROMOTE TRADE AND ECONOMIC EXCHANGES WITH INDIA: ROC OFFICIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China's top official in
India said Saturday in New Delhi that his country will do its utmost
to promote trade, economic and cultural exchanges with India.
</P>
<P>
Kao Cheng-chun, Taiwan's newly-appointed representative to India,
made the remarks while attending a reception held in honor of his
arrival to assume the new post.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Taiwan and India are both democratic, free and
peace-loving countries, Kao told the about 160 dignitaries in
attendance, including members of diplomatic corps, and leaders of
local business circles and overseas Chinese communities, that the
priorities of his office this year are promoting bilateral trade and
tourism exchanges as well as strengthening cultural and academic
exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that the two countries can help each other's
information industry, the Board of Foreign Trade of Taiwan's Ministry
of Economic Affairs had said earlier this year that one of its major
goals is to strengthen trade and economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that two-way trade between the two countries
only represents a minor part of Taiwan's total exports, the island's
trade with India has registered rapid growth over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Taiwan-India trade amounted to about US$1.4
billion in 2003, or an increase of 16.34 percent over the figure for
the previous year.

PRESIDENT AGREES TO IMMEDIATELY RECOUNT ELECTION VOTES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 27 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his
agreement Saturday on an immediate recount of votes of the March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the Presidential Office in
response to appeals made by Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), at a mass protest held in front of the Presidential
Office earlier that day, Chen said as long as Lien filed a lawsuit to
seek the annulment of last Saturday's presidential election, he will
submit immediately a written agreement on the issue to the court,
allowing an immediate recount.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who won re-election by a slim margin of 0.228 percent or
less than 30,000 votes out of the 13 million ballots cast in the
presidential poll over his sole challenger -- KMT Chairman Lien --
said that he will absolutely accept the results of the proposed vote
recount.
</P>
<P>
He urged Lien and his running mate, People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong, to openly declare that they are also willing to
accept the same results.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that he is willing to meet Lien and Soong
next Monday without any precondition.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the rival camp's suspicions that the March 19 gun
attack on Chen and his running mate -- Vice President Annette Lu --
was staged to win voters' support, the president said he supports
State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa's proposal that Dr. Henry
Lee, a world-renowned Chinese-American forensic expert, and other
experts recommended by the opposition camp be invited to join an
independent forensic panel to get to the bottom of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
With respect to Lien's claim that the activation of the national
security mechanism following the shooting barred many soldiers and
police officers from casting their ballots in the March 20 election,
Chen explained that only one-ninth of the soldiers were required to
stay in their barracks because of the national security mechanism
activation, less than one-sixth required in the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 supporters of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance", made up of the KMT and PFP, gathered in front of the
Presidential Office Saturday to protest against what they described
as an "unfair" presidential election which gave Chen another
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
Lien presented three appeals in the mass protest, including an
immediate recount of votes, formation of an independent panel to
investigate into the March 19 shooting and allowing re-voting by
soldiers and police officers barred from casting their ballots due to
the activation of the national security mechanism following the
shooting.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian presided over a
spring memorial service Monday for all those who died in battle for
the cause of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Chen, accompanied by Presidential Secretary-General Chiou I-jen,
led the heads of the five government branches, or the Executive,
Legislative, Justice, Examination and Control Yuans, in attending the
service held at Martyrs Shrine in Yuanshan in suburban Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Amid the sober sound of bells and drums, the president burned
incense, laid a wreath and then bowed three times to the altars of
the war dead during the solemn ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, the president offered his greetings to
representatives of the surviving relatives of the war dead.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the memorial service were officials from
governments of all levels, elected representatives and military
officers.
</P>
<P>
A memorial service was also held at the Martyrs Shrine in
Taichung, central Taiwan to commemorate the country's war dead as
well as Huangti, or the Yellow Emperor -- a legendary ruler said to
be the first emperor of the Chinese people -- with Taiwan Provincial
Government Chairman Lin Kuang-hua presiding.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Lin called for consolidation among all the
people of Taiwan now that the clamorous March 20 election is over,
saying that Taiwan cannot afford to be divided. He added that all the
Taiwan people are the offspring of the Yellow Emperor and that they
should not divide themselves because of different political
affiliations.
</P>
<P>
Similar memorial services were also held in Kaohsiung in southern
Taiwan, Changhua in central Taiwan, and other places around the

HEART PATIENT IN SINGAPORE TO GET REVOLUTIONARY STENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A made-in-Singapore stent that reduces
the risk of infection and scarring in heart patients is being
inserted into its first Singaporean patient Monday.
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary device, which has had promising results in
clinical trials in Germany, will be implanted into a patient at the
National Heart Centre by Eberhard Grube, a leading German
cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
A stent is a tiny metallic tube used to keep open an artery that
has been cleared of fat and cholesterol. The Singapore-made stent,
which is coated with a drug to prevent scarring, is special because
the drug has been mixed into a biodegradable polymer, similar to that
used in dissolving sutures. Current drug-coated stents on the market
use non-biodegradable material.
</P>
<P>
The drug covering the stent, developed by medical device company
Biosensors International, is called Biolimus, and is an
immuno-suppressant which stops the body from rejecting the stent.
</P>
<P>
The body's attempts to reject stents cause scarring, which narrow
the artery again. So, rather than remaining in the body as a foreign
object, the polymer disintegrates and is absorbed.

3-D IMAGE-GUIDED DENTAL IMPLANT SURGERY NOW AVAILABLE IN SINGAPORE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Singapore,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dental surgery to replace a decayed or
extracted tooth is fairly common in Singapore, but now, there may be
an even safer and easier way to carry out this operation.
</P>
<P>
The new technique uses an extremely accurate motion tracking
system, similar to GPS navigation systems. The patient goes through a
CT scan to map his bones and teeth, after which doctors decide on the
ideal location and angles for the implant.
</P>
<P>
During the procedure itself, if the drill deviates even slightly
from the planned route, the system will alert the surgeon. This means
that nerve damage is reduced and that placing the tooth becomes a
more accurate process.
</P>
<P>
Up to 7,000 dental implants are performed in Singapore each year.

LINES DRAWN OVER FORMATION OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A battle line was drawn between the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the "pan-blue alliance" of the
two main opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP) over the opposition's demand for a special
committee to investigate the March 19 shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The alliance believes that the incident -- in which Chen and his
running mate Vice President Annette Lu suffered slight injuries --
boosted Chen's popularity and helped him win the next day's election
by a razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liao Feng-teh, the secretary of the KMT legislative
caucus, claimed the best way to set up such an independent
investigation committee would be by an emergency decree by the
president, an idea has already been rejected by the president.
</P>
<P>
The alternative would be to set up a committee in the Legislative
Yuan based on a special act yet to be enacted, because the
Legislative Yuan has no power to investigate, Liao explained.
</P>
<P>
Such an act needs the DPP lawmakers' cooperation, which is not
possible without the approval of the president, who is the chairman
of the DPP, Liao went on.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, Liao's DPP counterpart in the
Legislative Yuan, confirmed Liao's prediction by criticizing the idea
as an infringement on the right of the judiciary system that does not
conform with the basic principles of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
If a special act could be enacted to empower the legislative
branch to conduct an investigation into the incident, it would negate
the existence of the judiciary branch and tilt the balance among the
executive, legislative and judicial branches, Tsai pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tsai's opinion was echoed by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU),
the DPP's political ally in the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chien-ming, a convener of the TSU legislative
caucus, said a special investigation committee under the Legislative
Yuan would only give rise to more chaos and prove that the KMT and
PFP have an axe to grind rather than simply wanting a vote recount as
they have claimed.

DOMESTIC INVESTMENT TO INCREASE THIS YEAR: OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Domestic investment is expected to
increase by 14.5 percent year-on-year, an official of the Economic
Planning and Development Council (CEPD) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
CEPD Vice Chairman Hsieh Fa-da said that the willingness of
domestic manufacturers to invest has been strengthened in light of
the fact that imports of machinery amounted to US$2.26 billion in the
first two months of this year, an increase of 49 percent over the
year-earlier figure.
</P>
<P>
Public investment has also been increasing since the
implementation of public construction expansion programs in the
second half of last year, Hsieh continued.
</P>
<P>
Public investment posted an annual growth of 2.2 percent in the
first quarter of this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he went on, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan has
forecast that Taiwan's economic growth will top 4.74 percent this

NOTHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT SHOOTING: U.S. SPECIALISTS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three specialists who came to Taiwan from
the United States to help investigate the election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that there is nothing suspicious
about the shooting judging from the information they had collected so
far.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by members of a special team formed to investigate
the shooting, the trio -- Dr. Cyril Wecht, an acclaimed forensic
pathologist; Michael G. Haag, a forensic firearms expert with U.S.
Forensic Science Consultants, Inc.; and Timothy Palmbach, a crime
scene investigative specialist -- went to Tainan in the south of the
country to visit the scene of the shooting and the Chi Mei Medical
Center, where Chen and Vice President Annette Lu, both of whom were
slightly injured, were taken for treatment.
</P>
<P>
At Chi Mei, they read the medical treatment records for Chen and
Lu on the afternoon of March 19, as well as examining X-rays and
scans and discussing the treatment with doctors there.
</P>
<P>
They initially determined that the wound examined by the ER
doctors was fresh when he arrived at the hospital. Chen suffered a 2
cm wide, 11 cm long wound when a bullet grazed his lower abdomen,
while another bullet scratched Lu's right knee.
</P>
<P>
Wecht stressed that he will not draw any conclusion until he has
conducted further studies in his U.S. laboratory, but after viewing
photos of the wounds provided by the Criminal Investigation Bureau
(CIB) , and with the information provided by Chi Mei, he initially
determined that it was very likely a fresh gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
Questioned why the president could still walk and even make phone
calls, Wecht pointed out that the bullet only grazed fatty tissue and
did not cause massive bleeding.
</P>
<P>
It was not a serious wound and anyone would be able to move
freely upon sustaining similar wounds, he said, adding that nothing
about the hospital's treatment was strange or suspicious.
</P>
<P>
Wecht said that they would take the information provided by the
CIB and Chi Mei back to the United States to compare the wounds,
bloodstains and bullets recovered to see if they match with the
information provided by the Chi Mei doctors.
</P>
<P>
The investigation results will be brought back to Taiwan April 12
by Henry Lee, a noted Chinese-American forensic expert who Taiwan's
State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa has invited to conduct a
forensic investigation into the shooting. Lee could not come earlier
because of other engagements and instead sent the trio to Taiwan for
the one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
They praised the CIB for its open and forthright manner and said
they were provided with all the information they need. They noted
that all the members of the team are highly trained, which was a far
cry from the way the U.S. government handled the investigation into
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. Wecht was one
of the members of the autopsy panel of the late U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
But Wecht also said that although the CIB has provided clear
pictures of Chen's wound, he still hopes to see the wound himself,
but the CIB has not complied with his request so far.
</P>
<P>
The pictures of Chen's wound were unveiled last week to dispel
any doubts surrounding the shooting, which some have speculated was
self-staged to win sympathy votes in the bitterly contested election
that saw Chen win re-election by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes
out of a total of 13 million votes against his rival, Lien Chan,
candidate of the "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
The president and vice president were shot while riding in an
open-top jeep on a street in Tainan. The roadway was lined with
supporters during the last day of campaigning and the attackers
managed to get off at least two shots unnoticed in the roar of
firecrackers, smoke and excited distraction of the crowds lining
Chen's route.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" have called for an
independent investigation into the shooting, which they suspect
tilted the outcome of the election in Chen's favor.

BOFT LIFTS RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS OF STEEL PIPE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) lifted
restrictions Monday on exports of five selected steel pipe items that
had been included in an export ban on 40 categories of steel products
announced by the government March 11.
</P>
<P>
BOFT officials said that an investigation has shown that domestic
production of the five categories of steel pipe exceeds demand and
that manufacturers rely heavily on exports for their survival.
</P>
<P>
The BOFT will continue to evaluate export restrictions on the
other 35 categories of steel products subject to the restrictions and
to make any necessary adjustments in line with the market situation,
the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The BOFT originally issued the interim restrictions on exports of
40 categories of steel products for six months, set to end Sept. 10,
in an effort to ensure that strong domestic demand for these goods
could be met.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the restrictions, exports of the 40 listed
categories, including cold rolled steel and scrap steel, must first
be approved and an export license obtained from relevant government
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total exports of the selected steel product
exports this year must not exceed the overall respective levels
posted for the whole of last year, while the monthly volume of
outbound shipments are not allowed to top one-twelfth of last year's
respective totals.
</P>
<P>
However, steel products whose annual outbound shipments are below
the 100-ton level are not subject to the rules, the officials added.

NO DATE FIXED FOR MEETING OF PRESIDENT, OPPOSITION LEADERS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a 90-minute meeting Monday of the
top aides of President Chen Shui-bian, opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong,
no date was fixed for a meeting between the three.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said after
meeting KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng and PFP
Secretary-General Tsai Chung-hsiung that Chen agrees with Lien's and
Soong's demand for a recount, conducted by the judiciary system, of
the votes in the March 20 presidential election in which Lien, with
Soong as his running mate, was defeated by Chen by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
Chiou said that Chen would also not take issue with the "pan-blue
alliance's demand for a panel formed under the Legislative Yuan to
investigate whether the government's decision to put the country's
armed forces and police on higher alert after Chen was shot on the
eve of polling day had deprived more military and police personnel of
their right to vote in the election than had previously been planned.
Lien and Soong believe those voters would have cast their ballots for
the "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
However, Chiou ruled out the possibility that Chen would agree
with the alliance's demand for an independent investigation by
presidential emergency decree into whether the shooting -- in which
Chen and his running mate, Vice President Annette Lu were slightly
injured -- was a political scheme designed to boost Chen's popularity
in the election.
</P>
<P>
Chiou did promise to convey to Chen the alliance's demand for a
special investigation team through a special act yet to be enacted,
if an emergency decree is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Chen looks forward to meeting with Lien and
Soong, not only to exchange views with them on the disputes arising
from the election, but also on ways of improving unity among the
people, as well as on policy concerning mainland China and economic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsai said Chen should first clear the questions
surrounding the election before seeking cooperation from the two
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Lin claimed that the formation of a special investigation team
through a presidential emergency decree would be the best way to cut
the Gordian knot and that a special act would only be an alternative
choice or even a last resort.
</P>
<P>
Chiou said he was pleased with Monday's meeting, which he said
cleared up many speculations and rumors, even though no date was set
for a meeting of Chen, Lien and Soong.
</P>
<P>
Except for the last demand, Chiou said, the "pan-blue alliance"
can go ahead with its plan to pursue a recount through a court ruling
and set up a panel in the legislature to investigate the government's
response to Chen's shooting.
</P>
<P>
Lin and Tsai were not so optimistic, describing the outcome of
Monday's meeting as far from satisfactory and saying that unless the
president agrees with the formation of an independent investigation
team to look into the shooting, any meeting of the three leaders
would be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
They said they hope the president will respond to the demands in
a positive manner.

According to the official, domestic demand for ketamine has been

NATIONAL SECURITY MECHANISM DID NOT AFFECT ELECTION: OFFICIAL

<P>
The activation of the national security
mechanism March 19 did not affect the presidential election held the

Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with the secretaries-general of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) ,
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said that the
number of military personnel and police officers required to remain
on duty did not change from the original plan worked out for the
March 20 presidential election due to the activation of the national
security mechanism following the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
Both KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong, who
formed the sole opposition ticket to challenge the Chen-Lu
re-election bid and lost the election by a hair-thin margin of 0.228
percent, or 29,518 votes out of more than 13 million ballots cast,
criticized the government's move, claiming that it deprived a large
number of servicemen and police officers of their voting rights and
thus changed the outcome of the poll in Chen's favor.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiou argued that only the heads of related government
agencies, particularly those in charge of national defense, foreign
affairs, finance, economic affairs, cross-strait affairs and top
aides from the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the
National Security Council were urged to suspend their leave following
the activation of the national security mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The military personnel and police officers required to stay in
their barracks or be on duty in the wake of the activation of the
national security mechanism accounted for only one ninth of the
total, as was originally planned two months prior to the poll, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said that
only 37,855 servicemen were unable to return to their registered
domiciles to vote, but the opposition legislators claimed that the
figure was far higher.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials of the National Police Administration (NPA)
said that the relevant statistics are still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Chang-chieh, PFP legislative whip, claimed that 200,000
military servicemen were unable to vote and asked the MND and the NPA
to provide the correct figure.

COAST GUARD TO STEP UP PATROLS AS BLUEFIN TUNA FISHING SEASON BEGINS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Kaohsiung,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
said Monday that it will step up patrols in the southern Taiwan
waters adjacent to the Philippines' 200-mile exclusive economic zone
as the bluefin tuna fishing season has begun.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen in the southern Pingtung area tend to focus on bluefin
tuna between March and June. For years, Taiwan fishing boats have
often been detained by Philippine authorities on the grounds that
they illegally intrude into the Philippines' economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The CGA called a meeting Monday to discuss measures to strengthen
the protection of Taiwan fishing boats operating in waters adjoining
Taiwan and the Philippines, where it was decided that the CGA will
send ships to patrol southern Taiwan waters twice a week between
March and June. During the off-season, the CGA usually patrols the
area twice per month.
</P>
<P>
A CGA official also urged crews of local fishing boats to produce
operation, navigation and communication logs, as well as charts and
all other legal documents, should they encounter Philippine coast
guard patrol ships.
</P>
<P>
Bluefin tuna, with its tender fatty flesh, has become a prized
delicacy in Taiwan in recent years and prime bluefin can fetch
NT$7,000 per kilogram. The "bluefin fever" in Taiwan has drawn the
attention of Philippine fishermen, who have also joined the chase for
the migratory fish, increasing the potential for conflict in the
overlapping area of the two countries' exclusive economic zones,
according to fishery sources.

NUMBER OF BAD CHECKS ISSUED DOWN IN FEBRUARY: CBC

<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Eric Liu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number and value of bad checks in
February dropped from the January levels as a result of an active
stock market and rising market turnover, a spokesman for Taiwan's
Central Bank of China (CBC) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 11.6 million checks with a total value of about
NT$2.179 trillion (US$65.04 billion) were drawn in February, 45,333
of which bounced, representing 0.39 percent of the total and a
combined value of about NT$9.7 billion -- a new low since 2000 --
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the decreases in the number and value of
bad checks to a continuing economic recovery at home, a booming stock
market and surging market turnover, all of which enabled enterprises
and individuals to monitor cash flow more efficiently.

PRESIDENT TO DELIVER ON PROMISE OF FULL BALLOT RECOUNT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian will deliver on
his promise to a full recount of the votes cast in the March 20
presidential election, Secretary-General of the Presidential
Office Chiou I-jen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chiou made the remarks when he met with secretary-generals from
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People First
Party to arrange for a meeting between Chen, KMT Chairman Lien Chan
and PFP Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said that the "pan-blue
alliance" would file a new lawsuit seeking to nullify the election
Monday and he expressed the hope that Chen will deliver on his
promise to write a letter of agreement to allow for a full recount of
the ballots.
</P>
<P>
According to Chiou, "there is no problem about a judicial recount
of the ballots."
</P>
<P>
The alliance filed a similar lawsuit with the Taiwan High Court
right after the March 20 presidential election, but the court
rejected it, as such suits can only be filed after an official
proclamation by the Central Election Commission (CEC) of the election
victors, which did not happen until last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chen responded Saturday to calls that day by participants in a
mass protest rally sponsored by the "pan-blue alliance" that he would
submit a written agreement on the issue to the court to allow an
immediate recount.
</P>
<P>
Chen won the election by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes out
of a total of 13 million votes cast, but the "pan-blue alliance" has
claimed that the election was "unfair." Lien has also called for an
independent investigation into the shooting of Chen and his
running-mate -- Vice President Annette Lu -- the day before the
election, which he believes played a role in tilting the bitterly
contested election in Chen's favor.

LEGISLATURE GRINDS TO A HALT OVER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  29  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Policial ripples from the March 20
presidential election continued to spread Monday, with lawmakers from
the two main opposition parties, the Kuomintang and the People First
Party, refusing en masse to attend a legislative session aimed at
discussing their demand for a revision of the President and Vice
President Election and Recall Law.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party urged
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to persuade the KMT and PFP
lawmakers to raise themselves beyond the dispute over the
presidential election and attend to their jobs at the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Lee Chun-yi, the secretary of the DPP Caucus at the Legislative
Yuan, urged Wang -- who is a vice chairman of the KMT and the
presidential campaign manager of KMT Chairman Lien Chan -- to act as
a meditator between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
"Their absence from the legislature will neither help resolve the
presidential election dispute nor serve the national interests, " Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
The KMT and PFP lawmakers boycotted the legislative session in an
attempt to press the DPP into agreeing to their demand for a recount
of the votes in the March 20 election, in which President Chen
Shui-bian beat Lien by a wafer-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Ker Chien-ming, DPP Convener at the Legislative Yuan,
also urged his KMT and PFP colleagues to stop spreading rumors and
speculation and allow the ripples from the presidential election to
settle.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Lien and his running-mate, PFP Chairman James
Soong, to put a planned meeting with Chen to good use by discussing
with him the issues of cooperation between the ruling and opposition
parties, finding ways to heal the rifts between different ethnic
groups after the election, economic development and constitutional
reform rather than simply airing their grievances against Chen.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the KMT-PFP "pan-blue alliance" has demanded that the
election be annulled by the judiciary, Ker urged Lien and Soong to
let justice run its course.
</P>
<P>
However their KMT colleague dismissed the DPP lawmakers, claiming
that they were trying to gloss over the dispute that it was an unfair
election.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liao Feng-teh, secretary of the KMT Caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, said no talks with the DPP on cooperation in
legislative reforms are possible before the government gives in to
the "pan-blue alliance" demand for an immediate recount and a full
investigation into the shooting of President Chen one day before
polling day and the government's subsequent activation of the
national security mechanism.
</P>
<P>
He said his party was not pinning its hopes on the legislature to
revise the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law,
which would allow for a recount.

MOI TO CONSIDER RAISING REWARD FOR PRESIDENTIAL SHOOTING INFORMATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien
said Monday that he might consider raising the reward for information
in the case of the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian one day prior
to the March 20 election to NT$100 million (US$3.02 million).
</P>
<P>
Yu made the remarks at an interior affairs committee meeting at
the Legislative Yuan. National Police Administrator Chang Su-liang
and Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) Commissioner Ho You-yi were
also on hand to give the first reports on the shooting since the
election, which saw Chen win re-election by a hair-thin margin of
29,518 votes out of 13 million votes cast against his rival Lien
Chan, the candidate of the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP).
</P>
<P>
Several KMT and PFP legislators raised questions about the
incident, which they believe played a role in the bitterly contested
election and changed the outcome in Chen's favor.
</P>
<P>
The legislators said that the "pan-blue alliance" has offered a
reward of NT$10 million and asked if the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) will raise the reward from NT$3 million to NT$100 million.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that he would "consider the request but will have to
study it with the National Police Administration and other related
agencies."
</P>
<P>
Ho claimed that "this was a standard shooting incident and there
is absolutely no possibility of its having being faked."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the slow progress of the investigation so far, he
said the bureau has been unable to determine the exact location of
the attacker, because there are different ways to shoot and from
different positions.
</P>
<P>
He added that except for the jeep in which Chen was shot while
canvassing in his hometown of Tainan in southern Taiwan -- which has
been impounded by the Tainan Prosecutor's Office -- all related
evidence is still in the possession of the CIB.
</P>
<P>
Legislators also said that Tsai Chao-ming, head of the National
Security Bureau, and Chen Tsai-fu, head guard of the Presidential
Office, should take responsibility for the shooting,
</P>
<P>
The duo should be suspended from their duties and removed from
their posts pending the investigation, they said.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liao Feng-teh, KMT party whip at the legislature,
noted that Tsai is a retired general, while Chen is on active service
in the military. According to the related regulations of military and
criminal law, they should not be safe from prosecution if they are
proved to have been negligent in their duty. Chen Tsai-fu was with
Chen and Vice President Annette Hu in the same open jeep when the
incident took place in the afternoon of March 19.
</P>
<P>
Huang Lei, deputy head of the National Security Bureau, said that
Tsai tendered his resignation one day after the shooting incident to
take political responsibility.
</P>
<P>
An appropriate punishment for other related personnel will have
to wait for the collection of more information before being decided,
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PFP legislators expressed concern about how many
military and police officers were unable to vote due to the
activation of a national security mechanism in the wake of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said that
only 37,855 servicemen were unable to return to their registered
domiciles to vote, but the legislators claimed that the figure was
far higher.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Chang-chieh, PFP legislative whip, claimed that 200,000
military servicemen were unable to vote and asked the MND and the
National Police Administration to provide the correct figure.

LIEN, SOONG SHOULD PAY FOR LOSSES CAUSED BY WEEK-LONG PROTESTS: TSU
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) said Monday that the defeated "pan-blue alliance" presidential
candidates should pay for losses caused by the alliance's week-long
post-election protests at the square in front of the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Chen Chien-ming, who concurrently serves as the TSU
legislative whip, said the 170-hour sit-in protests on Ketagalan
Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office have had a strong
adverse impact on national image, social order, economic development
and student rights.
</P>
<P>
"The defeated challenger, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan,
and his running mate, People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong,
should compensate for the losses because they organized the grueling
marathon demonstration to protest against alleged unfairness in the
March 20 presidential election," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Lien lost the election to incumbent President Chen Shui-bian by a
razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes out of about 13 million ballots
cast. Lien and Soong then incited their supporters to demonstrate
non-stop at the Presidential Office square for eight days.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday afternoon, about half a million Lien-Soong
supporters thronged the streets surrounding the Presidential Office,
demanding a vote recount and an independent inquiry into a failed
election-eve assassination attempt against Chen, which the opposition
camp claimed gave Chen unfair sympathy votes that swayed the election
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
According to Legislator Chen, the Lien-Soong camp's massive
protests caused an estimated decrease of NT$1.6 trillion in the local
stock market capitalization and average losses of NT$200,000 for each
stock investor.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, he claimed, real estate deals have shrunk by 80
percent over the past week as compared with the pre-election records.
Real estate-related advertising also declined 60 percent, more than
10,000 police officers worked overtime and the demonstrators left
more than 20 tons of garbage in the vicinity of the Presidential
Office.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, demonstrators spoiled historic relics in the area,
including the Taipei Guest House and the Chingfu Gate. Last Friday, a
group of Lien-Soong supporters also stormed the Central Election
Commission in an attempt to prevent the commission from formally
announcing President Chen's re-election. Repairs of these buildings
will require a large sum of money," the legislator said.
</P>
<P>
The TSU, which supported President Chen in the bitterly fought
presidential race, has set up a special telephone line allowing those
who sustained losses during the Lien-Soong camp's post-election
demonstrations to file complaints.
</P>
<P>
"Would-be applicants are also welcome to file complaints by
e-mail to the TSU Internet Web site at lytsu@ly.gov.tw, " said Chen
Chien-ming. "The TSU will compile all applications and then seek
compensation from the "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" rally in front of the Presidential Office
officially ended at 6 p.m. Saturday, but some demonstrators refused
to leave and had to be dispersed by riot police early Sunday. Some of
them then began a sit-in at the nearby Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial
Hall complex. They can legally stay there until April 3.
</P>
<P>
TSU Legislator Huang Chung-yuan urged the "pan-blue alliance"
leaders to lead their supporters away from the CKS Memorial Hall
complex and end all protest activities as soon as possible so that
calm can be restored to society and economic activities can proceed
normally.

TRAFFIC CONTROLS AROUND PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE LIFTED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taipei City Government lifted traffic
controls around the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei Sunday at
midnight, with traffic returning to normal Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" had occupied
the square in front of the Presidential Office since March 20 to
protest against what they perceived as an "unfair" presidential
election, which saw President Chen Shui-bian win re-election by a
slim margin of 29,518 votes out of 13 million ballots cast against
Lien Chan, Kuomintang party chairman.
</P>
<P>
A mass protest rally was held Saturday to highlight their demands
for a recount of the votes and an independent investigation of the
shooting of President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu on election
eve, in which both were lightly injured, which the protestors believe
changed the outcome of the election in Chen's favor.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of the protestors remained in the square after the
permit for the demonstration expired at 6 p.m. A large police force,
mainly comprised of female police officers, persuaded some to move to
the nearby Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall early Sunday morning, and
carried others away who were less cooperative.
</P>
<P>
Police were told beforehand that they should refrain from using
sticks and water cannons and use only their hands.
</P>
<P>
Judging that the protestors would not return to the square in
front of the Presidential Office, the Taipei City Government
announced it was lifting traffic controls around the Presidential
Office starting from Sunday midnight.
</P>
<P>
But to protect the safety of President Chen, traffic controls
around his official residence, which lies about 100 meters away from
the Presidential Office, are still in effect.

RESTRICTIONS ON MAINLAND CHINESE TOURISTS TO BE EASED: MAC
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Monday the regulations governing mainland Chinese
citizens' sightseeing trips to Taiwan will be eased soon as part of
the government's efforts to "double tourist arrivals by 2008."
</P>
<P>
MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong made the remarks after an
inter-ministerial meeting where officials from the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
reported on tourist arrivals from the mainland and other related
issues.
</P>
<P>
On an experimental basis, Taiwan began to allow mainland Chinese
students studying abroad and mainland Chinese citizens with permanent
residence in foreign countries to make sightseeing trips to the
island Jan. 1, 2001 under the principle of "group in, group out."
</P>
<P>
Quoting MOTC tallies, Chen said that 2,324 mainland Chinese
citizens in the two above-mentioned categories made leisure trips to
Taiwan in 160 groups in 2002. The number of mainland tourist arrivals
increased to 12,808 in 909 groups in 2003, and four of them have not
yet left Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the number of mainland tourist arrivals has fallen
short of expectations mainly because of Beijing authorities' failure
to include Taiwan in an official list of destinations where mainland
citizens are allowed to make leisure trips. As a result, he said,
overseas mainland Chinese citizens adopt a wait-and-see attitude
toward making sightseeing trips to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
With a view to enhancing tourist arrivals, Chen said the Tourism
Bureau has suggested that the "group in, group out" restriction on
mainland Chinese tourists be eased. At the moment, each group should
comprise at least five people.
</P>
<P>
"All relevant government agencies are evaluating this proposal.
The number of the group members may be cut. And we are also thinking
of offering more incentives to attract mainland tourists, " Chen
added.
</P>
<P>
He didn't touch on the proposal that ordinary citizens residing
in mainland China be allowed to make pleasure trips to Taiwan.

U.S. EXPERTS IN TAIWAN TO HELP INVESTIGATE ELECTION-EVE SHOOTING

<P>
Three U.S. criminal investigation
specialists have arrived in Taipei to help investigate the
election-eve assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian, the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Cyril Wecht, a nationally acclaimed forensic pathologist;
Michael G. Haag, a forensic firearms expert with U.S. Forensic
Science Consultants, Inc.; and Timothy Palmbach, a crime scene
investigative specialist, visited CIB headquarters in Taipei Monday
morning for a briefing on the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.
Vice President Annette Lu was also slightly injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Lu were shot while riding in an open-top jeep on a
street in Tainan City, southern Taiwan. The roadway was lined with
supporters during the last day of campaigning before the March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's particular brand of greeting by supporters along
roadsides is the lighting of large strings of firecrackers on both
sides of the road as the candidate's vehicle passes. The fireworks
are large, about the size of a little finger, and are not only
deafening, but give off large amounts of gunpowder smoke.
</P>
<P>
The gunman was able to get off at least two shots unnoticed in
the roar of the firecrackers, smoke and excited distraction of the
crowds lining Chen and Lu's route.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. experts proceeded to Tainan City in the afternoon
to begin their investigations in the hope that more evidence will be
obtained to help bring the perpetrator of the crime to justice. They
will visit the street where the shooting occurred and the Chi Mei
Foundation Medical Center, where Chen and Lu were examined and
treated.
</P>
<P>
The three-member group -- consigned by Dr. Henry Lee, who
Taiwan's State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa has invited to
conduct a forensic investigation into the election-eve shooting --
will stay in Taiwan for only one day.
</P>
<P>
Lee, meanwhile, will not be able to come to Taiwan until after
mid-April due to his tight schedule, according to CIB officials.
</P>
<P>
Wecht, one of the members on the autopsy panel of late U.S.
President John F. Kennedy, is currently chair of the Department of
Pathology at the Central Medical Center and Hospital in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. In November 2003, he organized a meeting on "Solving
the Great American Murder Mystery: A National Symposium on the 40th
Anniversary of the JFK Assassination."
</P>
<P>
According to Kuo Chen-ni, a Tainan City prosecutor presiding over
the investigation of the Chen-Lu shootings, her office has collected
a total of 96 items of information and possible evidence over the
past week. Of the total, 89 have been excluded while seven remain
valid. These the Tainan district prosecutors' office will continue to
study.
</P>
<P>
President Chen's opponent, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, who
lost to Chen in the presidential election by a razor-thin margin of
0.228 percent or 29,518 votes out of more than 13 million ballots
cast nationwide, has said that there were many questions surrounding
the election-eve shooting and demanded an independent investigation
into the incident.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday afternoon, about half a million of Lien's
supporters thronged the streets surrounding the Presidential Office,
demanding a vote recount and an independent inquiry into the failed
assassination attempt against Chen that the opposition camp claimed
had unfairly swayed sympathy votes Chen's way.
</P>
<P>
President Chen was grazed across his stomach in the shooting
while Lu suffered a minor wound to her right knee.

KMT URGED TO APOLOGIZE FOR VIOLENCE AT CKS MEMORIAL HALL COMPLEX
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) asked the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Monday to make a public apology for violent incidents at the
Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) Memorial Hall complex in downtown Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The DPP caucus made the demand after a Soochow University student
and a woman were beaten Sunday at a so-called "Democracy Square" at
the CKS Memorial Hall complex where scores of supporters of the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) were
staging a sit-in protest against alleged unfairness in the March 20
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In a brief English speech delivered at the "Democracy Square, "
the Soochow University student asked the demonstrators not to make
too much noise to spoil the quiet in the nearby region. Soochow
University's downtown campus is located near the CKS Memorial Hall
complex. The woman delivered a brief speech in support of President
Chen Shui-bian's administration.
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that the two victims were beaten simply because they
expressed different views at the 'Democracy Square, '" said DPP
legislative whip Tsai Huang-lang.
</P>
<P>
Since the KMT has "borrowed" the site for the sit-in, Tsai said,
the party should assume the responsibility for maintaining order and
should apologize to society for the incidents. "We hope no more
violence cases will happen at the site," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Chen narrowly defeated KMT Chairman Lien Chan in the
bitterly contested presidential election. Lien and his running mate,
PFP Chairman James Soong mobilized their supporters to demonstrate
non-stop at the Presidential Office square for eight days.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday afternoon, about half a million of Lien-Soong
supporters thronged the streets surrounding the Presidential Office,
demanding a vote recount and an independent inquiry into a failed
election-eve assassination attempt against Chen that the opposition
camp claimed had unfairly swayed sympathy votes Chen's way.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" rally in front of the Presidential Office
ended at 6 p.m. Saturday, but some demonstrators refused to leave the
site. They were dispersed by riot police early Sunday and some of
them then began a sit-in at the CKS Memorial Hall complex nearby.

TAIPEI Z00 ORANGUTAN TRANSPORTED TO JAPAN FOR BREEDING PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A four-year-old female orangutan who was
born in Taipei City Zoo was ferried to Japan on Monday as part of a
breeding program underway at the Himeji City Zoo, according to Taipei
City Zoo officials.
</P>
<P>
This marked the first time that Japan has imported a primate
since the country banned all primate animal imports in 1999 in an
effort to prevent animal epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Hsiao-chen," born at Taipei City Zoo more than four years ago to
Indonesia-originating parents, is expected to join the Himeji City
Zoo in late April after undergoing a one-month quarantine at Japanese
customs, the zoo officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Himeji orangutan breeding program, "Hsiao-chen" is
expected to mate with a seven-year-old male orangutan named "Keli" --
who was brought to the zoo from Taipei City Zoo in exchange for a
young red panda in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Although "Hsiao-chen" and "Keli" are both originally from Taipei
City Zoo, it will be all right for them to have offspring together
because the pair are not related by blood, the zoo officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to Himeji City Zoo officials, the Japanese government
gave the green light to import of "Hsiao-chen" based on reproduction
considerations after the one and only female orangutan at the zoo
died of unknown causes in recent months.
</P>
<P>
In order to acquire "Hsiao-chen, " the Himeji City Zoo had
promised to give four black-foot penguins, six ring-tailed lemurs and
six ruffed lemurs to Taipei City Zoo. The four penguins arrived in
Taipei last July, while the six lemurs are expected to be delivered
this year.

OPINIONS OF U.S. EXPERTS TO BE HEEDED: TOP PROSECUTOR
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's law enforcement authorities will
heed the professional opinions being provided by the three U.S. crime
scene specialists who are currently in Taiwan for a probe into the
election-eve assassination attempt, State Public Prosecutor-General
Lu Ren-fa said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of world-renowned forensics expert Dr. Henry
Lee, Michael G. Haag, a ballistics expert; Dr. Cyril Wecht, a
nationally acclaimed forensics expert; and Timothy Palmbach, a crime
scene identification analyst, arrived in Taiwan Monday morning and
immediately visited the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
headquarters in Taipei to examine the case evidence in the
assassination attempt against President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu on March 19.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trio then headed south to Tainan City, where they
examined the crime scene and collected additional relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
In the assassination attempt, President Chen was grazed by a
bullet and sustained a flesh wound to his lower abdominal region,
while Vice President Lu suffered a minor wound to her right knee.
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary look at the evidence kept at the CIB
headquarters, Wecht, one of the members on the autopsy panel of late
U.S. President John F. Kennedy, said that President Chen's wound was
a fresh wound and caused by a gunshot, and not anything else as
alleged by many people who suspect the shooting was staged.
</P>
<P>
Wecht told Taiwan media Monday that it was too early for them to
come to any other conclusions about the shooting incident and that
more time was needed to look at the facts and examine the evidence.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. experts, who are scheduled to leave Taiwan later
Tuesday, called on President Chen at the Presidential Office at
around noon. It was unclear as of press time whether the U.S. experts
would examine Chen's wounds during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Lu were shot while riding in an open-top jeep on a
street lined with supporters. The gunman or gunmen were apparently
able to get off at least two shots unnoticed in the roar of
firecrackers and the excitement of the crowds lining the president
and vice president's route.
</P>
<P>
In Tainan, the three U.S. experts visited the street where the
shooting occurred and the Chi Mei Foundation Medical Center, where
Chen and Lu were examined and treated.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Henry Lee, who was invited by Taiwan's State Public
Prosecutor General's Office to conduct the independent forensic
investigation into the shooting, asked the U.S. trio to come to
Taiwan first for an investigation trip. Lee, currently in New Zealand
for an international seminar on forensic investigations, is unable to
come to Taiwan until mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Wecht is currently chairman of the Department of Pathology at the
Central Medical Center and Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In
November 2003, he organized a meeting on "Solving the Great American
Murder Mystery: A National Symposium on the 40th Anniversary of the
JFK Assassination."
</P>
<P>
According to Kuo Chen-ni, a Tainan City prosecutor presiding over
the investigation into the assassination attempt, her office has
collected a total of 96 items of information and possible evidence
over the past week. Of the total, 89 item have been ruled out as
evidence, while the remaining seven will continue to be studied by
the Tainan district prosecutors' office, she added.
</P>
<P>
President Chen's opponent in the March 20 election, Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan, lost to Chen by the razor-thin margin of 29,518
votes, or 0.228 percent of the more than 13 million ballots cast
nationwide. In the days following the election, Lien said many
questions still surrounded the election-eve shooting and demanded an
independent investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday afternoon, about half a million of Lien's
supporters thronged the streets surrounding the Presidential Office,
demanding a vote recount and an independent inquiry into the shooting
incident which the opposition camp claims unfairly swayed sympathy
votes Chen's way.

U.S. EXPERTS: REPORT ON MARCH 19 SHOOTING TO BE READY BY MID-APRIL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)

<TEXT>
<P>
Three U.S. forensic experts invited to
Taiwan to look into the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian
said Tuesday that they will have completed their report on the
incident by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference before they left the country Tuesday night,
the three said they had collected a lot of material that needs to be
tested and analyzed and that until this work has been done, it will
be impossible to reach a conclusion on the shooting.
</P>
<P>
However, they said through an interpreter that their preliminary
investigation, including a private interview with President Chen
Shui-bian, suggested that the wound might have been caused by a
bullet rather than any other object as some critics of Chen have
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The bullet might not have been fired from a regular firearm, a
possibility that makes their investigation more difficult, said the
U.S. experts.
</P>
<P>
Noting that they are forensic experts and not detectives, the
three said their investigation focuses on whether the shooting was
genuine and their conclusion might not be helpful in finding the
perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
The three -- Dr. Cyril Wecht, an acclaimed forensic pathologist;
Michael G. Haag, a forensic firearms expert with U.S.
Forensic Science Consultants, Inc.; and Timothy Palmbach, a crime
scene investigative specialist -- were invited by local prosecutors
to verify the incident.
</P>
<P>
They arrived Sunday and during their whirlwind stay in Taiwan,
they called on Chen, visited the scene of the shooting in Tainan City
and went to the Chi Mei Medical Center, where the president sought
treatment after the March 19 incident.

DPP WILL SEEK TO BECOME MAJORITY PARTY IN THE LEGISLATURE: PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian called on his
campaign staff Tuesday to continue their efforts to help the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) win the upcoming legislative
election scheduled for December.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who serves concurrently as DPP chairman, made the appeal
while meeting with campaign workers before the DPP Central Standing
Committee's weekly meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We must win the majority of the 225 seats in the Legislative
Yuan in the year-end legislative elections so as to become a fully
ruling party. We cannot let down our guard," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he also expressed his heartfelt gratitude to
the party officials for their painstaking efforts to help him win
re-election.
</P>
<P>
According to DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, the party
is scheduled to call an extraordinary session of its national
delegates April 10 to deliberate draft amendments to regulations
governing the nomination of candidates for the legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the DPP became the largest party in the
legislature three years ago and he voiced the hope that his party
will be able to win a majority of the legislative seats in the
year-end election.
</P>
<P>
He declined to answer a question as to whether he will compete
for the Legislative Yuan presidency as a DPP legislator-at-large if
the DPP gains a legislative majority.

DPP RESERVED ON IDEA OF INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE AT LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  30  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "pan-blue alliance" idea for the
formation of an investigation committee under the Legislative Yuan to
look into the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian could be
unconstitutional in two ways, ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the ruling party's Central Standing
Committee, Chang said authorizing the Legislative Yuan to investigate
criminal cases through special legislation, as demanded by the
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP), could encroach on the
power of the Control Yuan, which is the government's supreme
watchdog, and on the authority of the Ministry of Justice, which is
tasked with crime investigation.
</P>
<P>
Chang said he understands the depression of the KMT and PFP after
losing the presidential election by only a wafer-thin margin, but he
expressed reservations about their demand for a special investigation
committee in the Legislative Yuan on the grounds it could destroy the
delicate system of checks and balances between the different branches
of government.
</P>
<P>
The "pan-blue alliance" conveyed its demand to President Chen
Shui-bian a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the president has yet to express an opinion on the
demand but added that an answer of "no" might be inevitable, since a
"yes" answer would ruin the country's hard-earned democracy.
</P>
<P>
Noting that KMT Chairman Lien Chan is clamoring for a entirely
new presidential election, Chang said he was surprised, since the
court has not yet ruled on Lien's demand for an annulment of the
election.
</P>
<P>
Lien and his running mate, PFP Chairman James Soong, also suggest
that the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian one day before polling
day was a political scheme designed to boost Chen 's popularity, and
have demanded -- via their party lawmakers -- an investigation into
the incident by the Legislative Yuan.

<P>
President Chen Shui-bian received a
certificate confirming his election as the Republic of China's
11th-term president in a ceremony held at the Presidential Office
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This certificate looks light, but for me, it is extremely heavy.
It is not just a certificate of election. It is like a signed note
containing my promise to the 23 million people of Taiwan, " Chen said
after receiving the certificate from Central Election Commission
(CEC) Chairman Huang Shih-cheng.
</P>
<P>
During his second four-year term, Chen said, he will make every
possible effort to deliver on his campaign promises to "unify Taiwan,
stabilize cross-Taiwan Strait relations, reinvigorate the economy and
promote social stability and harmony."
</P>
<P>
"I'm grateful for the support of the electorate and I'll live up
to their expectations. I won't disappoint them," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his heartfelt gratitude for all the election
staff for their devoted services. "We jointly wrote a new chapter in
Taiwan's history through this hotly contested election," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen defeated his sole challenger, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan,
with a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes, 0.228 percent, out of some
13 million ballots cast in Taiwan's most closely fought presidential
election. Lien has filed a lawsuit for an annulment of the election
over what he claims was "unfairness" in the election.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's ceremony, Huang also presented a certificate to
Vice President Annette Lu confirming her re-election.

OFFICIALS ENCOURAGE MANUFACTURERS TO EXPLORE EUROPEAN MARKET
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  30  (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials suggested Tuesday that domestic manufacturers consider
investing in 10 Central and East European countries soon to be
admitted to the European Union (EU) , in order to make inroads into
the vast European market.
</P>
<P>
From May 1, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Cyprus and Malta will be
formally integrated into the EU, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
This will not only bring the EU's member states from the current
15 to 25 but will increase its total population to 370 million, its
gross domestic product (GDP) to US$10.4 trillion and its total trade
volume to US$4.8 trillion, thereby making it the world's largest
economic community, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the official noted, their entry is expected to bring
direct economic benefits worth 10 billion euros for current EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
As some of the newcomers, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland, boast excellent industrial foundations, qualified labor
forces and lower wages, many manufacturers from advanced countries in
Western Europe have set up production lines in Central and East
Europe, the officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The officials further said that several multinational enterprises
seeking to globalize their operations, such as IBM and Motorola, have
also relocated their production lines from Western Europe to East
Europe, while several Taiwan-based companies, such as Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., ASUSTek Computer Inc. and Acer Sertek
Incorporated have also carried out investment projects in the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate their entry into the EU, the 10 countries are
working to improve their administrative efficiency and revise trade
laws, as well as to improve environmental protection, social order
and human rights, the officials explained, adding that now is a good
opportunity for domestic manufacturers to invest there.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, customs duties for the 10 nations
will be lowered from the current 9 percent to 4 percent after their
accession into the EU.

NO NEED FOR TAIWAN TO DECLARE INDEPENDENCE: EX-PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Tokyo,  March  30  (CNA)
(By Perry Hsieh and Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's March 20
re-election reflects the fact that awareness of a "Taiwan identity"
has been cemented among the Taiwan people and that there is no need
for the Taiwan government to declare independence, a Japanese daily
newspaper quoted former President Lee Teng-hui as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks in Taipei Monday during an exclusive
interview with the Sankei Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the former president had commented to
a foreign media outlet on the presidential poll, in which Chen beat
the sole opposition challenger -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan -- by
a razor-thin margin of 0.22 percent, or fewer than 30,000 votes out
of more than 13 million ballots cast.
</P>
<P>
Describing the election result as having laid a solid foundation
for Taiwan to start a new era of full democracy, Lee said that the
awareness of a distinct Taiwan identity among the general public is
evident in Chen's re-election, which he claimed is also a victory for
Taiwan's indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for Taiwan to maintain a high Taiwan-centric
consciousness in the run-up to Beijing's hosting of the Olympic Games
in 2008, but there is no need for the island to declare independence,
Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The top priority after Chen begins his second term is to repair
relations with the United States and to review cross-Taiwan Strait
issues, according to Lee.

REFERENDUM NOT A FLOP: PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian said in an
interview with the Washington Post Monday that Taiwan's first
referendum, held alongside the March 20 presidential election, was
not a flop, even though it failed to pass the 50 percent threshold
require to make it valid.
</P>
<P>
Chen said more than 7.4 million eligible voters cast ballots in
the referendum on two questions -- whether Taiwan should buy more
anti-missile systems in the face of mainland China's mounting missile
threat and whether Taiwan should negotiate a "peace and stability"
mechanism for interaction with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"The number of referendum ballots far exceeded the number of
votes I received in the presidential election, " said Chen who
garnered 6.47 million ballots to secure a second four-year term.
</P>
<P>
From this perspective, Chen claimed, the referendum received a
warm response and support from the general public.
</P>
<P>
Chen attributed the invalidity of the referendum mainly to the
high threshold set by the Referendum Act. According to the act, a
referendum will be considered valid only when at least half of the
electorate casts a ballot. Under this rule, at least 8.2 million
would have had to take part to make the March 20 referendum valid.
</P>
<P>
"If the formula used in the presidential election were to have
been applied to the referendum, it would have been counted as valid,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In the presidential election, the percentage was calculated on
the basis of ballots that were actually cast, not on the basis of the
number of eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
Chen said an opposition boycott of the referendum, coupled with
mainland China's intimidation, had adversely affected the
participation rate.
</P>
<P>
"One other unfavorable factor was the layout of the referendum
voting. I believe that many voters simply forgot to pick up and cast
referendum ballots after they cast their presidential election
ballots," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In any event, Chen went on, he was glad to see the referendum
proceed smoothly without any glitches. "With this experience, we have
taken a step forward in deepening our democratic system," he added.
</P>
<P>
The one-hour interview was conducted by David Huffman, the
Washington Post's diplomatic news editor, and Philip Pan, the paper's
Beijing correspondent, at the Presidential Office. The interview was
published in the paper's March 29 issue.

Kaohsiung City has been awarded the
sponsorship of the 2006 annual conference of the International
Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations (IFATCA) , an
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The official from the Bureau of Transportation under the
Kaohsiung City Government said the city government joined the ROC Air
Traffic Controllers' Association to bid for the right to stage the
conference while attending the four-day, 43rd Annual IFATCA
Conference in Hong Kong last week.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 officials and air controllers from Taiwan went to
Hong Kong for the annual conference, the official said, adding that
Kaohsiung was selected over Nigeria by 60-plus countries out of
around 80 countries to win the sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the IFATCA was established in 1961,
and is a non-political international professional organization
representing approximately 40,000 air traffic controllers in 128
countries. Taiwan was enrolled in 1980 under the name of ROCATCA, one
of the few organizations still in the name of the Republic of China,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
The IFATCA holds its annual conference in a different country

58% OF EXECUTIVES WILLING TO WORK IN MAINLAND CHINA: POLL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  May 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty-eight percent of company executives
who responded to a recent poll would be willing to work in mainland
China in the next 12 months, according to the results of the survey
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey on executives' willingness to work on the mainland
also show that 56 percent of those polled have been to the mainland
on business or have been stationed there for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Those who said they would be willing to work on the mainland in
the next 12 months cited primarily the vast potential they see on the
mainland, as well as the personal challenge involved.
</P>
<P>
Forty-two percent said they have no intention of working there,
mainly because of family considerations, according to the poll
results.
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that while three years ago, those sent to
work on the mainland would have expected a salary at least 1.5 times
what they receive in Taiwan, nowadays they would be content with 20
percent more than what they could earn in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In terms of age groups, those aged between 45 and 54 have the
strongest desire to work on the mainland, with 65 percent of that age
group saying they want to go, followed by the 35-45 age group.
</P>
<P>
In terms of job type, those who are keenest to go are in the
service and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Among the high-ranking executives surveyed, 77 percent also said
they would most like to be stationed in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Further analysis shows that the higher an executive's annual
salary, the keener he would be to work on the mainland, especially
those who have an annual salary of between NT$2 million and NT$2.5
million (US$60,420-US$75,520)
</P>
<P>
The survey mainly focused on those aged 34-44, who accounted for
80 percent of those polled. Among the respondents, those in the
electronics and information sectors comprised the largest group of 38
percent, followed by the financial sector at 17 percent and the
service sector at 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Those who have an annual salary of between NT$500,000 and NT$1.5
million accounted for 63 percent, while those who have work
experience between six and 15 years accounted for 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by a survey company at the commission of the
human resource company HR Genie Digital Service Inc. between Feb. 2
and March 10, collected 521 valid questionnaires and had a margin of
error of 4.3 percent.

PROSECUTOR CONFIDENT OF SOLVING ELECTION-EVE SHOOTING CASE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities are confident
that they can solve the presidential election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, a chief
prosecutor of the State Public Prosecutor General's Office of the
Supreme Court said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tseng Yung-fu made the remarks while at a meeting in the
Legislative Yuan called by a judicial policy team of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) . The meeting to discuss the
shooting was also attended by National Police Administrator Chang
Su-liang.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said that under the law, a prosecutor can consign outside
experts to take part in the investigation of a criminal case and
report their findings for reference to prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
State Public Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa's invitation to Dr.
Henry Lee, a noted forensic expert who grew up in Taiwan and made his
name in the high-profile O.J. Simpson case, to assist with the
investigation is such an approach, Tseng said.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who is now based in the United States and is currently
attending a meeting in New Zealand, has asked three other experts
from the United States -- Dr. Cyril Wecht, an acclaimed forensic
pathologist, Michael G. Haag, a forensic firearms expert with U.S.
Forensic Science Consultants, Inc., and Timothy Palmbach, a crime
scene investigative specialist -- to come to Taiwan to collect more
information about the shooting. Lee himself will come to Taiwan April
12.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trio called on President Chen Tuesday morning. They also
visited the scene of the shooting in Tainan City and went to Chi Mei
Medical Center where the president and vice president sought
treatment after they were lightly injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Tseng stressed that the State Public Prosecutor General's Office,
the National Police Administration and the Investigation Bureau are
capable of solving the case using the existing system, and that he
does not favor bringing in other investigators from outside the
established framework.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Duan Yi-kang of the ruling DPP raised questions about
Lee, an expert recommended by the "pan-blue alliance, " saying that
Lee's political stance could affect the results of the investigation
and that other international experts should also join the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
His colleague, Yeh Yi-chin, said that Lee has taken holiday
leaves in mainland China every year at the invitation of the
mainland, and teaches in the mainland. Lee is also a key member of a
support group of the "pan-blue alliance" in the Greater New York
area, Yeh said.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot but worry if this will affect his professional
judgment," he added.
</P>
<P>
DPP Legislator Chou Jung-tai wondered why Lei Chien, a former
legislative candidate from the New Party, accompanied the three
foreign specialists to the shooting scene and was interviewed by the
media.
</P>
<P>
"Lei has nothing to do with the probe and she is not a
criminologist, and it is strange that she should take part in the
case," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tseng said that the specialists will submit a written report for
the reference of prosecutors and that they should refrain from
speaking to others on the case beforehand about their findings.
</P>
<P>
State Public Prosecutor General Lu has asked the three foreign
experts to follow strictly the principles of confidentiality
regarding the case, Tseng said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Lei has no relevance to the investigation and
it is indeed inappropriate for her to accompany the experts, adding
that there are English translators in law enforcement department and
there is no need for Lei to do the translation.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place on March 19 when the president and vice
president were canvassing in a open-top jeep in Tainan, southern
Taiwan. Both were lightly injured, but the shooting was considered to
tilt the bitterly contested election in Chen's favor. The president
won re- election by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes out of a
total of about 13 million votes cast, against his rival, Lien Chan of
the "pan-blue alliance."

20 PERCENT OF TAIWAN FAMILIES TO OWN DIGITAL CAMERAS IN 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 percent of Taiwan families are
expected to own a digital camera this year, up from 17 percent
recorded late last year, a domestic camera company sales manager said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a new product promotion, the Koda Taiwan sales
manager said that the penetration rate of digital cameras among
Taiwan families will increase to 20 percent in 2004, thanks to
product simplification that makes the devices easier to use.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a survey conducted by GfK -- a United
States-based marketing research and customer satisfaction service --
the global market scale of digital cameras hit around 660,000 units
in 2003, with the figure likely to rise to 1.3 million for 2004, the
Koda executive said, adding that between 70 percent and 75 percent of
worldwide users are first-time users.
</P>
<P>
At present, 70 percent of the users are men, with the number of
female users growing fast, he noted, adding that 3 mega pixel and 4
mega pixel models are the most popular.
</P>
<P>
The digital camera ownership rate in the United States was around
30 percent as of the end of last year, with units priced at between
US$100 and US$700 being the best sellers. The top priority for 45
percent of U.S. consumers when buying a digital camera was
resolution, while 41 percent pointed to price as their primary choice
motivator.

U.S. NEWSPAPER REPORTS WRONGLY ON CHEN STATEMENT: PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Presidential Office said Tuesday that
Washington Post reporters have misinterpreted President Chen
Shui-bian's remarks on his basic stance on relations with mainland
China during his second term.
</P>
<P>
Chen gave a one-hour interview with David Huffman, the Washington
Post's diplomatic news editor, and Philip Pan, the paper's
correspondent in Beijing, at the Presidential Office a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the paper's online version of the interview, the two
journalists wrote in the lead of their report: "President Chen
Shui-bian of Taiwan condemned China on Monday for blocking popular
demands for democratic reforms in Hong Kong, saying its actions have
made the Taiwanese more determined to reject unification with the
mainland and to continue building their own 'independent, sovereign
country' despite the risk of war."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the lead, Presidential Office spokesman James Huang
said it was misleading.
</P>
<P>
"The Washington Post journalists apparently misinterpreted
President Chen's explanations of his fundamental stance and policy
guidelines, " Huang said, adding that Chen did not utter any of the
words that appeared in the lead.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Huang said, Chen stressed that Taiwan will not
be drawn into an expensive arms race with mainland China and will not
develop offensive weapons to deter a mainland attack.
</P>
<P>
"In the interview, President Chen clearly said he wants to put
aside his differences with Beijing on Taiwan's status and to begin
negotiations to improve cross-strait relations, including
establishing a viable mechanism for peaceful interaction, opening
direct air and shipping links and reducing military tensions, " Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed as "misleading and misinterpreting" the paper's
headline: "Taiwan President Raises the Stakes With China Again."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the headline and the lead, Huang said the Washington
Post report on Chen's interview was generally correct. It was Chen's
first interview with the media since a failed attempt on his life
March 19 and his narrow re-election victory the following day.

VOTE RECOUNT EXPECTED TO BEGIN SOON: PRESIDENTIAL AIDE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  30 (CNA)
(By Luis Huang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian's letter of
consent to allow for an immediate and across-the-board recount of
ballots cast in the March 20 presidential election is expected to be
delivered to the Taiwan Hight Court soon, a presidential aide
disclosed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chih-fang, director of the Department of Public Affairs
under the Presidential Office, made the remarks after the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) filed a lawsuit for the nullification of Chen's victory
in the election Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Noting that President Chen has directed ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung to form a team
of lawyers to handle the case, Huang said he is confident that the
president's letter of consent will be submitted to the High Court in
a few days to facilitate an immediate recount of votes as demanded by
the "pan-blue alliance."
</P>
<P>
In response to the opposition camp's requests at a Saturday news
conference, Chen said that as long as the alliance's presidential
contender files either an annulment or a recount lawsuit, he would
sign a letter of consent to allow for an immediate and complete
ballot recount regardless of whether evidence of election fraud is
provided.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of the recount, and it is my commitment to fully
accept the results of the recount whether or not they are in my
favor. I hope that KMT Chairman Lien and PFP Chairman Soong will be
able to do the same," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
KMT spokesman Chou Shou-hsun said that the lawsuit was filed on
the grounds that there are many suspicious points concerning the
March 19 gun attack on the Chen-Lu ticket and that the national
security mechanism was activated improperly following the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The shooting was said by the "pan-blue alliance" to have been
staged to win sympathy votes from eligible voters and the alliance
claimed that a host of soldiers and police officers were deprived of
their right to cast ballots in the election because of the national
security mechanism activation.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Lu were lightly wounded when an unidentified assailant
fired at least two shots at them while the candidates were driving
past large crowds of supporters in an open-top jeep in the southern
city of Tainan March 19. The shooting grazed Chen's abdomen and hit
Lu's right knee.
</P>
<P>
The Lien-Soong ticket lost the election to the Chen-Lu ticket by
a razor-thin margin of 0.228 percent.

PRESIDENT CHEN OUTLINES FOUR PRINCIPLES FOR SECOND TERM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday outlined
solidarity, cross-Taiwan Strait stability, law and order and economic
prosperity as the four principles to rule the country during his
second term in the coming four years.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remarks at the weekly Central Standing Committee of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -- the first of its
kind after he succeeded in his re-election bid following the March 20
presidential election, in which he edged out the sole opposition
candidate -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan -- by a very slim margin
of 0.228 percent. Chen also serves as chairman of the DPP.
</P>
<P>
Stating that his re-election marks the beginning of a new era and
a new stage of responsibilities, Chen said that the ruling party must
learn to be humbler, united and work harder to assume its full
responsibilities for the country and its people.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that a "united Taiwan, " a "stable cross-strait
relationship, " as well as "social stability, " and a "prosperous
economy" will be the top four goals of his government during the four
years ahead and called for greater respect, compassion and leniency
for different opinions in compliance with law and order.
</P>
<P>
At a time when large crowds are protesting over the election
outcome, another large group of people are doing their best to keep
silent and remain patient for the sake of love for this country, Chen
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of which camp you belong to, the 23 million people of
Taiwan should embrace each other with love and leniency," he urged.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his belief that the current woes will be
eventually over and he added that Taiwan society will become stabler
and prosperous after tackling over the impact. He vowed to continue
carrying out reforms on a wide range of fronts, including the
financial, judicial, educational, social and legislative areas.

ROC SEVERS DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH COMMONWEALTH OF DOMINICA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Republic of China broke off diplomatic
relations with the tiny Caribbean island nation of the Commonwealth
of Dominica Tuesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien
announced at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"All of the ROC's financial aid programs for Dominica have also
been canceled," Chien said.
</P>
<P>
Chien's announcement came after Dominica forged formal ties with
mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Chien said he feels deep regret that mainland China has offered
huge financial aid to entice Dominica into switching diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Chien, Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit had
requested US$58 million in various aid programs shortly after he
assumed office in January following Pierre Charles' abrupt death.
</P>
<P>
"Those demands far exceeded the existing cooperative programs
between our two countries and most of the programs had nothing to do
with Dominica's national development and people's livelihood, " Chien
said.
</P>
<P>
In the negotiation process, Chien said Skerrit had on many
occasions threatened to switch diplomatic allegiance to Beijing if
Taiwan failed to satisfy his demand. Ignoring the ROC's dissuasion,
Skerrit signed a joint communique with Beijing on the establishment
of diplomatic ties on March 23, Chien said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the ROC has no intention of competing with Beijing
in the "dollar diplomacy" game, Chien said mainland China's
diplomatic offensive against Taiwan will not help cross-Taiwan Strait
relations and will not gain the approval of Taiwan's 23 million
people. "This will only make cross-strait relations worse," he added.
</P>
<P>
With an ultimate aim to annihilate the ROC's existence, Chien
said, mainland China's diplomatic strategy has focused on luring away
all of the ROC's diplomatic allies and blocking the ROC's
participation in international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing should stop its diplomatic stranglehold against the ROC
because such moves only hurt the feelings of the people of Taiwan, "
Chien said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government has adopted a pragmatic attitude
toward boosting external relations on the basis of reciprocity, Chien
said he hopes local people will support the government's decision to
cut ties with Dominica.
</P>
<P>
The ROC established diplomatic ties with Dominica in 1983. Over
the past 21 years, the ROC government has assisted Dominica in various
national development projects, including stationing a five-member
technical mission since 1985 to help the Caribbean country of 70,000
people develop agriculture and aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
Javier Ho, director of the Central and South American Affairs
Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), said the ROC
government will seek repayment of more than US$1 million in
outstanding loans to Dominica through legal procedures. "And we'll
evacuate our embassy in Dominica after completing all necessary
procedures," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, MOFA spokesman Richard Shih said mainland
China used the period of Taiwan's presidential election to engage in
"dollar diplomacy" and suppressed the ROC's survival in the
international arena by luring away Dominica.
</P>
<P>
"We express our serious objections and condemnation," Shih said.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign wire service reports, mainland China
promised to offer more than US$100 million in aid to Dominica over
the next six years, beginning with US$11 million up front.

TAIWAN-MADE NOTEBOOK PCS TO HOLD 70 PERCENT OF WORLD OUTPUT IN 2004
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan's output of notebook personal
computers is expected to top 32 million units this year, grabbing a
dominating 70 percent of the entire world market of such increasingly
popular products, the non-profit Institute for Information Industry
(III) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Continuing to be the leading manufacturing country of notebook
PCs, Taiwan churned out more than 18 million units in 2002 and
substantially increased to 25 million units in 2003, said Chiang
Fang-yun, a chief product analyst of the III.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's notebook PC makers are expected to produce a record high
32 million units this year, with the output in the first quarter
exceeding seven million, Chiang forecast.
</P>
<P>
Chiang attributed the brisk growth of Taiwan's notebook PC
manufacturing industry to the increasing PC retirement and
replacement rate among businesses around the world; the rising trend
of replacing desktop PCs with notebooks among general users; and
additional orders placed by international big-name computer-makers
with Taiwan manufacturers on an OEM basis.
</P>
<P>
Despite increasingly severe competition from counterparts in
Japan and South Korea, Taiwan's notebook PC-makers have been
continuing to flourish because they have been able to win orders that
otherwise would go to Japan and South Korea by offering competitive
prices, Chiang noted.

DROUGHT IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN COULD MEAN MORE WATER RESTRICTIONS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Farmers in southern Taiwan are praying for
rain as dry days continue and the drought shows little sign of
subsiding, meaning that more water restrictions could be imposed in
the future, sources from the Water Resources Agency (WRA) said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With water levels at major reservoirs in southern Taiwan falling
to record lows due to sparse rainfall, the WRA does not exclude the
possibility of imposing a new round of fallow plans for farmland and
rice paddies in the weeks to come, said WRA chief secretary Wu
Yueh-hsi.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation in the Tsengwen-Wushantou Reservoir, the
largest in Taiwan and the main source of water in the southern part
of the country, has dropped to some 72 million tons as of Monday
after months of dry weather, according reservoir officials.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the reservoir dropped to 172.66 meters
Tuesday, the third-lowest level recorded on the same day in the past
30 years, reservoir officials said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the WRA imposed the first round of fallow plans for
farmland and rice paddies in southern Taiwan for this spring to save
water and allow households and industrial water users to enjoy normal
supplies. These condition are expected to hold until the end of May.
</P>
<P>
If the upcoming monsoon season does not bring enough rainfall to
southern Taiwan, Wu said, the WRA will soon start planning for a
second-phase fallow plan to be imposed in the second quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during a national anti-drought task force
meeting sponsored by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, northern Taiwan as a whole has fared comparatively
better, with water in major reservoirs maintaining comfortable levels
as a result of continued wet weather, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
The Feitsui Reservoir, the main water source in the greater
Taipei area, and the Shihmen Reservoir in neighboring Taoyuan County,
will have no problems meeting normal water-use needs of northern
Taiwan residents and users until the end of May, Wu noted.

FEITSUI RESERVOIR BUREAU OPPOSES DRUG ADDICT FACILITY
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taipei City Government said Tuesday it
does not approve of the Ministry of Justice's (MOJ's) establishment
earlier this year of a detention center for drug addicts in the
vicinity of Feitsui Reservoir because of concerns about pollution.
</P>
<P>
Kang Shih-fang, director of the Feitsui Reservoir Administration
Bureau, said the number of drug inmates and staff at the drug
treatment center in Taipei County's mountainous Pinglin township is
expected to reach 1,200 in two years, or about one-fifth of Pinglin's
current population of 6,000. He added that by then, the center will
turn out more than 300 tons of waste water per day.
</P>
<P>
As the center is only one kilometer away from the Peishih Creek
in the upper stretch of Feitsui Reservoir, Kang said he is worried
that waste water from the drug treatment center might flow into the
Peishih Creek and eventually pollute water in Feitsui Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Feitsui Reservoir is the main source of drinking
water for 4 million residents in the greater Taipei area, Kang said
the establishment of the Pinglin drug addict detention center
threatens the region's water supply safety.
</P>
<P>
"We think it's inappropriate to set up a drug center in the
reservoir's vicinity," Kang said, adding that the bureau will send a
letter to the central government expressing its opposition to the
facility.
</P>
<P>
Taipei City Government spokesman Wu Yu-sheng said the Pinglin
drug treatment center was originally a vocational training facility
under the now defunct Garrison Command. The facility had laid idle
for many years before it was turned into a drug treatment center
early this year. According to the current regulations, Wu said, an
environmental impact evaluation is needed for establishing such a
facility in the vicinity of Feitsui Reservoir.

<P>
Noting that the Dominican Republic is the first country he

PRESIDENT CHEN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
London, March 30 (CNA)
(By N. K. Han and Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROC President Chen Shui-bian has
reaffirmed his commitment to constitutional reform during his
second four-year term.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC), Chen also
reiterated that Taiwan is an independent sovereign state while
pledging to stabilize ties with mainland China.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to make continuous efforts to stabilizing
cross-Strait relations, eventually reaching peace across the
Taiwan Strait and stability and security in the Asia-Pacific
region," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully eventually we will become a peacemaker instead
of a troublemaker," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He also told BBC that his plan to adopt a new constitution by
2008 is a timetable for Taiwan's democratic and constitutional
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"It is never a timetable for independence. If anyone who
regards this as a timetable for independence then it is a
serious misunderstanding and a serious distortion," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Chen further said whether Taiwan will adopt a new constitution
will be decided by the people of Taiwan through a referendum. The
implementation of a new constitution has nothing to do with the
"independence or unification" issue and will not change Taiwan's
present status quo, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chen held Taiwan's first-ever referendum alongside
the March 20 presidential election. Although the referendum on
beefing up missile defence failed because fewer than 50 percent of
voters participated, Chen said voters proved they wanted
an independent Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"As we can see from the election this time, even the
opposition parties cannot oppose the mainstream value, the will
of the people, [who] oppose unification of the two sides and
insist on Taiwan being an independent sovereign country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of Taiwan people cannot accept Taiwan
becoming a second Hong Kong, nor can we accept Taiwan becoming
a local government of the People's Republic of China or a
Special Administrative Region of China," Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Chen won re-election with a narrow margin of 29,518 votes
out of some 13 million ballots cast. His sole contender, Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan has filed a tawsuit to the high court contesting
Chen's victory, saying an election-eve assassination attempt that
slightly wounded Chen had led to a swelling of sympathy votes.
Chen has given his consent to the high court for a complete vote
recount.
</P>
<P>
Chen told BBC he believed that the crisis stemming from the
election dispute would soon be over.

DPP TO DISCUSS AMENDING LEGISLATIVE NOMINATION RULES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Wednesday it will hold an extraordinary party congress
April 10 to discuss partial amendments to its legislative election
nomination regulations.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed amendments are part of our preparations for the
year-end legislative election," said DPP Deputy Secretary-General Lee
Chin-yung.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments include authorizing the DPP chairman to
recommend several candidates for the overseas and aboriginal
representative seats for the approval by the party's Central
Executive Committee, Lee said, adding that the revisions are aimed at
enhancing representativeness of its nominees.
</P>
<P>
During a lunch meeting with party officials Tuesday, President
Chen Shui-bian, who concurrently serves as DPP chairman, said the DPP
should strive to win a majority in the new legislature to be elected
late this year to facilitate implementation of the party's ambitious
reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
During his first four-year term, Chen was unable to undertake his
major reform programs as the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
often stonewalled passage of relevant bills.
</P>
<P>
"Now that I have been re-elected, our next goal is to control a
majority of the seats in the legislature to facilitate implementation
of our reform agenda," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to the DPP's work schedule, it will decide on the
number of candidates to be nominated for each legislative
constituency. The party's nomination list will be unveiled in
mid-June in terms of the results of direct voting by party members as
well and the outcome of a series of public opinion surveys.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DPP said it will organize a "thanksgiving party"
at Yuanshan No. 1 Park near the Grand Hotel in Taipei in the evening
of April 10 to mark the re-election of President Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
"The gala party is mainly aimed at expressing our heartfelt
gratitude for the electorate's support in the fiercely fought
presidential election, " said Cheng Wen-tsan, deputy director of the
DPP's publicity department.
</P>
<P>
"We'll arrange more musical programs to replace political
speeches in the party as we hope the event can help defuse the
confrontational atmosphere resulting from the fiery, bruising
election campaign," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
President Chen narrowly defeated his sole challenger, Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan, by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 ballots out of
some 13 million cast in the March 20 presidential election. Lien
contested the outcome and filed a lawsuit earlier this week for an
annulment of the election on the grounds that the election-eve
shooting of Chen unfairly swayed sympathy votes for him. Both Chen
and Lu were slightly injured in the March 19 assassination attempt on
them while campaigning in the southern city of Tainan.

Taichung Mayor Jason Hu promised
Wednesday to promote direct flights between Taichung and Hong Kong
and Okinawa as well as direct charter flights with Xiamen and Shantou
in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the promise in response to a call made by a group of
local business leaders, including Lai Cheng-i, chairman of the
Taichung Chamber of Commerce, during a meeting at the Taichung City
government headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Pledging that he will relay the idea to the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , Hu said that direct
flights will not only make the homecoming of the more than 50,000
mainland-based businessmen from central Taiwan easier, but it will
also give a boost to Taichung's tourism and make the city more
cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that he will propose the CEPD allow direct flights
between Taichung's Chingchuankang Airport and Hong Kong and Okinawa
from July and charter flights linking destinations in mainland China,
such as Xiamen in Fujian province and Shantou in Guangdong province,
during the next Chinese new year holiday season.
</P>
<P>
According to Lai, China Airlines -- the Taiwan's largest carrier
-- has contacted him to assess the feasibility of opening direct
flights on the Taichung-Hong Kong and the Taichung-Okinawa routes as
more than half of the passengers on board CAL flights from Taiwan to
Hong Kong are businessmen from central areas.
</P>
<P>
Lai also suggested Hu invite the chiefs from neighboring cities
and counties to work jointly toward the aim.

<P>
The Board of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is urging Taiwan businessmen not to
travel to Ivory Coast Wednesday, citing the volatile political
condition there.
</P>
<P>
Ever since a coup attempt in September 2002, Ivory Coast has
continued to be socially unstable, an official with the Board of
Foreign Trade said, adding that the bloody clashes between government
soldiers and the opponents of government in the capital, Abidjan, has
prompted the opposition party to launch a series of peace parades
which has caused concerns from countries such as the U.S., Canada,
England, France, Switzerland. They have called on their nationals to
refrain from traveling to Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
Ivory Coast used to be one of Taiwan's most important trading
partners, the official said, but bilateral trade has been sharply
impacted by the unstable situation, with trade falling from US$44.68
million in 2002 to US$19.10 million in 2003, out of which the imports
from Ivory Coast has dropped from US$26.08 million to US$8.48
million.
</P>
<P>
According to the representative office there, the official
continued, the turmoil in Ivory Coast won't be settled in the near
future, adding that to prevent their lives from being threatened, he
urged businessmen not to travel to Ivory Coast for now.

and the United States will grow even stronger.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a party held at the U.S. Congress to celebrate the
25th anniversary of the promulgation of the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA), Chen Chien-jen said that the decision of former President
Jimmy Carter a quarter of century ago to sever diplomatic ties with
the Republic of China was a "shocking one."
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Congress then formulated the TRA, Chen noted, which
he said has not only maintained U.S. interests and bilateral
relations but also stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
It has also helped produce a good environment for the development
of Taiwan's economy and society, which has helped it move forward on
the path of freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Chen conveyed his heartfelt appreciation for the United States
and said he hopes bilateral relations will be further upgraded based
on the existing solid basis.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States has helped in Taiwan's bids to
join international organizations such as the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade Organization (WTO), and
he expressed hope that Taiwan can soon join the World Health
Organization as an observer, again with the assistance of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The United States severed diplomatic ties with the Republic of
China in January 1979 and Congress passed the TRA March 29 of the
same year. It was signed into law April 10 by Carter.

DR. HENRY LEE TO ARRIVE APRIL 13 TO HELP IN PROBE OF SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Henry Lee, a world-renowned
Chinese-American forensic scientist, will arrive in Taipei April 13
to assist in the investigation into an assassination attempt on
President Chen Shui-bian March 19, the nation's top prosecutor said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Judicial Affairs
Committee, State Public Prosecutor-General Lu Ren-fa said he has
invited Lee to examine evidence in the election-eve shooting of
President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu.
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped that Dr. Lee could come to Taiwan as soon as
possible. Because of his busy schedule, however, Lee cannot arrive
until the evening of April 13. He is scheduled to leave Taipei April
15," Lu Ren-fa told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Lee would be able to produce a definitive report on
the shooting before his departure, Lu Ren-fa said he must respect
Lee's opinion. "I cannot give him a timetable."
</P>
<P>
The president and vice president were both slightly wounded by
two bullets from what is believed to have been a homemade gun as they
campaigned in the southern city of Tainan March 19. After they won
re-election by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes out of the more
than 13 million ballots cast in the following day's election, the
defeated contending ticket of Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
and People First Party Chairman James Soong contested the outcome
and filed a lawsuit for an annulment of the election on the grounds
that the shooting unfairly swayed sympathy votes for the Chen-Lu
team.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ren-fa said if necessary, Lee has agreed to testify to the
case in the Taiwan High Court, which is screening Lien's election
annulment suit.
</P>
<P>
Responding to independent Legislator Su Ying-kuei's suggestion
that an independent prosecutor be appointed to investigate the
shooting, Lu Ren-fa said such a move would deal a severe blow to
Taiwan's prosecutorial system.
</P>
<P>
"The United States scrapped its special prosecutor system last
year after it found flaws in the system. For years, I have been
opposed to the introduction of a special prosecutor system for
Taiwan," Lu Ren-fa said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed opposition to the KMT proposal that a special
investigative committee be created under the Legislative Yuan through
special legislation to look into the election-eve shooting.
</P>
<P>
"If the proposal were adopted, it would seriously hurt our
prosecutorial system," Lu Ren-fa stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Judicial Yuan said Wednesday that if the high
court decide to recount all ballots cast in the March 20 presidential
poll, it will offer all necessary administrative support.
</P>
<P>
The Lien-Soong ticket has demanded a complete vote recount and
President Chen and Vice President Lu have presented a letter of
consent to the high court. With their consent, the plaintiffs need
not present any evidence of irregularities to justify their demand
for a judicial recount.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, the high court announced it will hold the
first hearing on the unprecedented presidential election lawsuit this
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not to recount, how to recount, and the extent
of a recount is something that the tribunal needs to consult
with the two sides about," Taiwan High Court spokesman Wen Yao-yuan
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"What we will do on April 2 is to understand the situation
on both sides," Wen said.
</P>
<P>
There was no word on when the judges could reach a decision
and when a recount might begin, if one was ordered.

ECONOMIC PROCESSING ZONES WELCOME INVESTORS: EPZA
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,   March   31   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Economic Processing Zone
Administration (EPZA) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs has
extended a welcome to both traditional and hi-tech businesses to
invest in the country's economic processing zones (EPZs).
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation made by the administration, there
are about 130 hectares of vacant land scattered around the country's
EPZs, such as the Kaohsiung Economic Processing Zone and the Nantze
Economic Processing Zone, an EPZA spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Companies from various sectors are welcome to open up shop at the
EPZs, which are focusing on a shift from traditional labor-intensive
and manufacturing facilities to value-added and diversified compounds
and are keen on luring investors from the foreign trade,
telecommunications, warehousing and service-oriented industries, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with launching investments in Taiwan's hi-tech
industrial parks -- which require a higher investment threshold -- it
is easier to set up strongholds in EPZs, the spokesman said. In
addition, companies investing in EPZs are subject to different
standards as part of the administration's efforts to pursue
diversification and create more job opportunities for local
residents, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Nine EPZ investment projects, mainly from the hi-tech and
value-added industries, were approved in the first two months of this
year, with their combined value amounting to NT$ 1.45 billion. There
were six additional capital increment plans worth a total of NT$4.2
billion (about US$126 million) during the two-month period.

The Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will not

Answering questions from lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, Kuo

CPC raised the price of its gasoline and diesel by NT$0.6 per

CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY MECHANISM DEMANDED
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition camp will file a compliant
with the Council of Grand Justices to demand a constitutional
interpretation of the disputed launch of the national security
mechanism following the attempted assassination of President Chen
Shui-bian, which it claims markedly affected the outcome of the March
20 presidential poll.
</P>
<P>
Members of the legislative caucus of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) and a group of lawyers made the announcement at a news
conference held Wednesday at the Legislative Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong
aligned to form the sole rival ticket to challenge President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu in the election. Lien lost
the race to Chen by a hair's-breadth margin of 0.228 percent.
</P>
<P>
The day before the election, Chen suffered a gunshot to his lower
abdomen in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally,
prompting Premier Yu Shyi-kun to order the activation of the national
security mechanism later the same day.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of military and police personnel who were unable
to return to their registered domiciles to vote as a result of the
incident is disputed, with the Ministry of National Defense putting
the number at about 37,000 and the "pan-blue alliance" claiming that
the number exceeded 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Chang-chieh, a PFP whip, said a group of lawyers has been
handling the issue and he added that they will raise the demand for
clarification of the issue as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh strongly questioned the need for the government to
implement the mechanism based on an explanation provided by the
National Security Bureau, which said late March 19 that it had ruled
out the possibility of political motivation or elements involved with
mainland China behind the gun attack.
</P>
<P>
He accused Premier Yu of violating government procedure by giving
the order to implement the mechanism, because the order should have
been issued by the president, the National Security Council
secretary-general or his deputy, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
If there was no need for the government to enact the national
security mechanism as a result of the "slight injury" sustained by
the president in the assassination attempt, then the authorities who
issued the order abused their power and violated the human rights of
many citizens, as well as the universal principle of justice, the
lawyers claimed.

FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN TAIWAN UNAFFECTED: MOEA OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in Taiwan has
not been affected by the current dispute over the March 20
presidential election, a government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chu Ta-wen, director-general of the Industrial Development and
Investment Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
acknowledged that the mass protest staged last Saturday by the
opposition camp has stirred up grave concern among foreign investors
with operations in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
But Chu claimed that foreign direct investment willingness has
not been noticeably undermined now that the demonstrations, which
prompted about 500,000 people to take to the streets in Taipei, have
ended smoothly. Short-term political instability is not expected to
have a major impact on foreign investment projects at home, which are
usually launched only after long-term assessment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he went on, construction of a plant by Japan's Hoya
Corporation in the fourth compound of the Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park will kick off April 2 as scheduled, while mass
production is slated to begin by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Hoya, Chu said, another 13 multinational enterprises
have invested in Taiwan this year, including heavy hitters such as
Alcatel and DuPont. Meanwhile, there are an additional 26 promised
investment plans by other foreign investors, he added.

MAC OFFICIAL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT POST-ELECTION CROSS-STRAIT TIES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Wednesday that he is optimistic about cross-Taiwan
Strait relations in the wake of Taiwan's fiercely fought presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on post-election cross-strait relations, Jan
Jyh-horng, director of the MAC's Research and Planning Department,
predicted that cross-strait relations will move forward in the wake
of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"Both Taiwan and mainland China need a stable environment for
economic development and the international community wants the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait to make peace with each other. Against
this backdrop, the two sides must put aside some of their disputes in
order to allow relations to gradually move forward," Jan said.
</P>
<P>
As Taiwan's top mainland policy planner, Jan said, the MAC will
do whatever it can to push cross-strait relations in a positive,
constructive direction.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the March 20 presidential poll, President Chen Shui-bian
promised that if he were to be re-elected, he would push for the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait to exchange envoys before his May 20
inauguration for a second four-year term.
</P>
<P>
Now that Chen has narrowly won re-election, Jan was asked whether
this promise can be realized.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides really need a viable dialogue mechanism to enhance
understanding and trust. We have expressed our desire to exchange
envoys and representative offices to facilitate communication. It's
up to mainland China to decide whether the proposal can become a
reality," Jan said.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of policy continuity, Jan said the
"four noes plus one" pledge Chen promised in his 2000 inaugural
speech will continue to be followed.
</P>
<P>
The "four noes plus one" statement refers to Chen's pledge that
there will be no change to the national flag or title, no referendum
on Taiwan independence and no enshrinement of the "two states" theory
in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The core spirit of the pledge is to maintain Taiwan's status
quo. And this will be the gist of our future policy guidelines no
matter which party is in power," Jan added.

U.S. HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER WELCOMES VISIT BY ROC PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Washington, March 30 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay
(R-TX) said Tuesday that he would welcome President Chen Shui-bian
should he make another visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
DeLay made the remarks while attending a party to mark the 25th
anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. legislation that
has governed relations between the United States and Taiwan since the
two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1979.
</P>
<P>
DeLay said that he expects bilateral relations will be further
strengthened during Chen's second term.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would support a visit by Chen to Washington,
D.C. during his second term, DeLay said: "Absolutely. I hosted
President Chen in Houston and we had a very good time and created a
personal relationship during that visit. So anytime the president
wants to come, I'm very supportive, even to Washington."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he has talked to the White House about this in
light of the fact that the Bush administration seems to have a
different view on the issue, DeLay said that he has always talked to
the White House about Taiwan and about Taiwan-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Turning to his views on Chen's plan to introduce a new
constitution, DeLay said that is a decision for the Taiwan people.
"That's not something that the U.S. should dictate or even
comment on. That's part of freedom. If they want to have a different
constitution, that's their right to do so."
</P>
<P>
On the March 20 presidential election, he said that the message
sent to the whole world is that democracy and freedom is flourishing
in Taiwan and that the whole world should be very happy about that.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever we can find freedom and have it blossom, it's very good
for everyone in all parts of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to DeLay, nearly 20 U.S. senators and congressmen
also attended the party, during which they said they attach great
importance to the TRA.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) said that the
TRA helps maintain close relations between the American and
Taiwanese people and provides a solid basis for bilateral exchanges
in business and other relations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the election, he noted that the Central Election
Commission has announced that Chen won re-election. Although the
dispute over the election is not yet over, the high turnout rate of
80.2 percent at the polls proves the Taiwan people's genuine love for
democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States has weathered many crises during
its democratic process and that he believes it will be the same for
Taiwan, although the future is bright for both countries.

BEIJING HOLDS THE KEY TO RECONCILIATION: MAC OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing holds the key to whether the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait can appoint representatives from each side
in efforts to seek peace and stability across the strait, a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In view of President Chen Shui-bian's recent calls for both sides
to seriously consider engaging in negotiations through formally
authorized representatives as soon as possible, Jan Jyh-horng,
director of the MAC's Department of Research and Planning, said that
although Taiwan is willing to do so immediately, it will still
require willingness from both sides before any cross-strait consensus
on the matter can be reached.
</P>
<P>
Jan quoted MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen as having said recently
that for benign interaction across the strait, there must be a
marriage of "a subjective intention and an objective climate."
"Formal cross-strait interaction in a spirit of goodwill will be
impossible if either of these two conditions are absent, " Tsai was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Jan stressed the importance of delegating representatives from
both sides, saying that only through such officially authorized
representatives can the two sides communicate sufficiently and avoid
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
He said the mainland Chinese authorities have become increasingly
confident in China's economic reforms and growth and he expressed
hope that the Beijing leadership will also become confident in
China's internal reforms and cross-strait relations so as to benefit
the creation of an easier environment for better cross-strait
interaction.
</P>
<P>
In his first news conference with members of the media from home
and abroad this year held Feb. 3 to promote the March 20 referendum,
Chen called for a cross-strait agreement to serve as the basis for
future cooperation and the maintenance of peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
"With the concrete, common goal of seeking peace and stability,
we must seriously consider engaging in negotiations through formally
authorized representatives from both sides as early as possible, "
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"After March 20, " the president went on, "we will invite
mainland China to appoint a special envoy to meet and work with our
special envoy towards the initiation of cross-strait negotiation, in
light of 'one principle and four major issue areas.'"
</P>
<P>
The "one principle" is the establishment of the principle of
peace, Chen said, adding that in order to establish joint
responsibility for maintaining peace and the consensus for
cooperation, both sides must recognize that maintaining peace in the
Taiwan Strait is the joint responsibility of both parties and should,
therefore, necessitate working together.
</P>
<P>
The "four issue areas, " meanwhile, are: the establishment of a
negotiation mechanism; exchanges based on equality and reciprocity;
the establishment of a political relationship; and the prevention of
military conflicts.

GOVERNMENT RAISES REWARD TO NT$50 MILLION FOR SHOOTING INFORMATION
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday that he
has agreed that the Ministry of the Interior should increase the
reward for information leading to the capture of the assailant or
assailants of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu
to NT$50 million (US$0.66 million).
</P>
<P>
If the Ministry of the Interior does not have sufficient budget
to pay the reward -- which was increased from NT$12 million -- the
Executive Yuan will use the Second Reserve Fund to make up the
balance, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The election-eve assassination attempt occurred in the southern
city of Tainan March 19 while Chen and Lu were riding in an
open-topped jeep on a street lined with supporters. Both Chen and Lu
were slightly injured when a gunman or gunmen is believed to have
taken advantage of the roar of firecrackers and the excitement of the
crowds to fire two shots at the president.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuo Chen-ni, a Tainan city prosecutor presiding over
the investigation into the assassination attempt, her office has
collected a total of 96 items of information and possible evidence
over the past week. Of the total, 89 have been ruled out as evidence,
while the remaining seven will continue to be studied by the Tainan
District Prosecutors' Office, she added.
</P>
<P>
Chen's opponent in the election, Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan,
lost to Chen by a razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes, or 0.228 percent
of the more-than 13 million ballots cast nationwide. In the days
following the election, Lien said many questions still surround the
shooting and demanded an independent investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon of March 27, about 500,000 of Lien's supporters
thronged the streets surrounding the Presidential Office, demanding a
vote recount and an independent inquiry into the shooting, which the
opposition camp claims unfairly swayed sympathy votes in Chen's
favor.
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. crime experts, traveling on behalf of world-renowned
forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee, arrived in Taiwan Monday to help
investigate the shooting.
</P>
<P>
In related news, Central Election Commission Chairman Huang
Shih-cheng said Wednesday that if a judicial vote recount is
conducted, the recount should be first filed in a lawsuit at the
Taiwan High Court and the costs of the recount and related affairs
should be footed by the side that loses the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the President and Vice President Election and
Recall Law, costs should be decided by the court that receives the
lawsuit, Huang added.

PREMIER DISMISSES REPORTS OF IMMEDIATE CABINET RESHUFFLE
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei,  March  31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Yu Shyi-kun denied Wednesday
reports that there has been a decision made to reshuffle the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The premier was responding to reports by the mass-circulation
China Times that after the Cabinet resigns en masse in April,
President Chen Shui-bian is sure to retain Yu and only undertake a
partial reshuffle of the Cabinet. The paper had claimed that the
interior, education and economic affairs ministers are about to be
replaced and that the number of Cabinet spokesmen will be increased
to two.
</P>
<P>
"The reports are a far cry from the truth," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Cabinet will resign en masse according to
established constitutional practice before a new president is sworn
in May 20, but said he is "not in a position to talk about Cabinet
changes at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Yu said that he was surprised by the reports, adding that during
the week-long period of protests and disputes over the result of the
March 20 election -- which Chen won by a razor-thin margin of 29,518
votes -- he did not have a chance to discuss with the president the
issue of the make-up of the new Cabinet or even to report to him on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that people outside the loop will not
speculate and said he called the interior, education and economic
affairs Wednesday to ask them not to "lose confidence" when
questioned by the media and not to give misleading information.
</P>
<P>
As to whether he will retain the post of premier, Yu said he must
respect the president's authority on the matter, pointing out that
the president has his own considerations and plans for the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
Lin Chia-lung, spokesman of the Executive Yuan, said that Yu's
Cabinet will resign en masse in due time and that all Cabinet members
will stay in their posts until then.
</P>
<P>
It would be premature to speculate on any new Cabinet lineup, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On whether the number of Cabinet spokesman will be increased, Lin
said that this must be a "creation of the media, " adding that in
theory, the fewer spokesman the better, in order to keep
communication problems to a minimum.

CONTROL YUAN TO PROBE MALFEASANCE IN ELECTION-EVE SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Taipei, March 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Control Yuan President Fredrick Chien said
Wednesday that the nation's supreme watchdog body has formed a panel
to probe whether there has been any administrative malfeasance in the
March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian.
</P>
<P>
The three-member panel will investigate any possible misconduct
or negligence on the part of national security units in protecting
the safety of the head of state, Chien said.
</P>
<P>
The panel will also look into whether there was any wrongdoing in
activating the national security mechanism after Chen and Vice
President Annette Lu were shot on the campaign trail on the eve of
the bitterly fought March 20 presidential election, Chien added.
</P>
<P>
As to a proposal initiated by the opposition camp that
legislation be enacted to allow for the formation of an investigative
committee under the Legislative Yuan to probe the assassination
attempt, as well as the incident's impact on the presidential
election outcome, Chien said the Control Yuan is the most appropriate
body to organize a panel to carry out such work.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, the Control Yuan is the supreme
supervisory organization, exercising the powers of impeachment,
censure and audit.
</P>
<P>
Chien said the Control Yuan panel will investigate the
administrative branch's handling of the shooting in a rational and
impartial manner.
</P>
<P>
As for the case's criminal investigation, Chien said, law
enforcement authorities will be in charge. "The Control Yuan is not
in a position to handle criminal investigations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Control Yuan investigative panel is composed of three members
-- Huang Wu-tsu, Chao Jung-yao and Chen Chin-li. Chao said the panel
will investigate possible malfeasance of the National Security
Bureau's special service center, which is responsible for the head of
state's safety.
</P>
<P>
A Control Yuan member who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the controversy surrounding the activation of the national security
mechanism will also be probed.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for legislation to legalize the formation of a
Legislative Yuan investigative committee to probe the shooting was
brought up by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) during a meeting with
Presidential Office Secretary-General Chiou I-jen a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng and PFP Secretary-General
Tsai Chung-hsiung came up with the proposal during their meeting with
Chiou to hammer out an agenda for a planned meeting of President
Chen, KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Lu were both slightly wounded by two bullets from what
is believed to have been a homemade gun as they campaigned in the
southern city of Tainan March 19. After they won re-election by a
razor-thin margin of 29,518 votes out of the 13 million ballots cast
in the following day's election, the defeated Lien-Soong ticket
contested the outcome and filed a lawsuit for an annulment of the
election on the grounds that the shooting unfairly swayed sympathy
votes for Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen has yet to express his opinion about the "pan-blue alliance"
proposal and KMT Secretary-General Lin said Wednesday that the
"pan-blue alliance" is waiting for his response. In his view, Lin
said, if Chen rejects the proposal, then the proposed Chen-Lien-Soong
meeting would be meaningless.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said that authorizing the
Legislative Yuan to investigate a criminal case like the March 19
shooting through special legislation could be unconstitutional in two
ways -- encroaching on the power of the Control Yuan and on the
authority of the Ministry of Justice, which is tasked with crime
investigation.

TRANS ASIA, XIAMEN AIRLINES TIE KNOT ON CROSS-STRAIT PACKAGES
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
Xiamen,  March  31 (CNA)
(By K.Y. Ni and Deborah Kuo)
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan-based Trans Asia Airways and
mainland China's Xiamen Airlines tied a cooperative knot Wednesday to
jointly offer convenient cross-strait travel packages mainly
targeting mainland-based Taiwan businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
The cross-strait travel packages, based on the extended "mini
three links" framework, feature two-way airline services among
Taipei, Kaohsiung, Kinmen, Xiamen and Macau and from those cities to
50 other destinations around the world.
</P>
<P>
Trans Asia President Sun Hung-hsiang and Xiamen Airlines
President Wu Rongnan signed the cooperation agreement on behalf of
their respective companies at a ceremony held at the Xiamen Airlines
Jinyan Hotel in downtown Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The convenient cross-strait travel packages plan is aimed at
upgrading the southern Chinese coastal city of Xiamen to the third
major transit center behind Hong Kong and Macau for mainland-based
Taiwanese businesspeople, believed to number at least 800,000, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of China's Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) took the initiative to open the "mini three links" on Jan. 2,
2001, to allow direct trade, postal and shipping links between the
ROC outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland Chinese
port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian Province to help
facilitate bilateral exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The MAC extended and expanded the "mini three links" program
March 1 of this year to allow Taiwanese businesspeople from other
mainland Chinese cities beyond Fujian Province to travel between
Taiwan and mainland China via the "mini three links" channel.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen Airlines is rated as one of the best airlines in mainland
China, winning the prestigious "Golden Goose Cup" over the past three
consecutive years, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, an average of 12,000 people traveled across the
Taiwan Strait via the "mini three links" channel each month last
year. Of the total, about 80 percent were Taiwanese businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
The total number of trips by Taiwanese businesspeople, their
dependents and elderly mainland-originating ROC military veterans to
and from mainland China via the "mini three links" channel will
definitely grow by leaps and bounds following the expansion of the
"mini three links" program, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted, after the mainland authorities give the
green light to Fujian residents to travel to Kinmen for tourism --
expectedly by the beginning of next month -- more people from the
mainland will also likely take advantage of the Trans Asia-Xiamen
Airlines cross-strait travel packages for tours.
