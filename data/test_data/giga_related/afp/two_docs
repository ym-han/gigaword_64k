<P>
Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile on Tuesday accused Japan and the
European Union (EU) of jeopardising moves toward global free trade by
making the World Trade Organization (WTO) miss a key deadline on
agricultural reform.
</P>
<P>
Vaile said foot dragging by anti-reformists among the 145-member WTO
had led to the organisation missing its March 31 deadline for
agreeing on the "modalities" -- or nuts and bolts details -- of
freeing up farm trade.
</P>
<P>
"The world is living dangerously, with multilateral institutions
being undermined by bilateral and regional efforts," he said.
